# Dev_Server

This is the repo of web resources on my EC2 server. I use this server to learn and practice my programming skills.

# Pages

Welcome page: https://ec2.zhuxiaotan.xyz (HTML, Sass)

Random User Generator page: https://ec2.zhuxiaotan.xyz (VueJS)

I am trying to make the webpages mobile-friendly, but you would get a better experience viewing these web pages on a desktop device.
