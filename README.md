# Dev_Server

This is the repo of web resources on my EC2 server. 

I use this server to learn / practice my front-end and back-end skills.

# Pages

Welcome page: https://ec2.zhuxiaotan.xyz (HTML, Sass)

Random User Generator page: https://ec2.zhuxiaotan.xyz/random_user_generator/ (JavaScript, VueJS)

Test Reaction Time page: https://ec2.zhuxiaotan.xyz/reaction_time/ (TypeScript, VueJS)

I aim to make the webpages mobile-friendly, but you would have a better experience viewing these web pages on a desktop device :)
