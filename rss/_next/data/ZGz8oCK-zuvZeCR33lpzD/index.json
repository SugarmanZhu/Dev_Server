Some of the movies (such as My Policeman) are getting theatrical runs before they're available for streaming on Prime Video. Others are exclusively streaming on Prime — we've noted both release dates, when applicable, in our list below\nHere's every original movie coming to Prime Video this fall.\nTop pick: Nanny\nAisha (Anna Diop) is an undocumented Senegalese single mother trying to build a new life for her young son by working as a nanny to a rich and entitled couple in Manhattan. Day and night, she is run ragged by this fraught family's demands, racist microaggressions, and outright avarice. But not even sleep gives her rest, as strange nightmares of sneering doppelgängers, creeping spiders, and mythical creatures haunt her. Before long, they begin to creep into her waking hours, too. Are they a warning or a threat? Can she make out their murky message in time?\nIn her feature film debut, writer/director Nikyatu Jusu employs folklore and surreal horror to turn the all-too-real struggles of immigrant mothers into a vividly haunting thriller. A story of contrasts and conflict, Aisha's humble home and cheerful community explodes with bold colors, while the apartment of her employer is a draining sprawl of grays. In costume and attitude, a captivating Diop reveals the code-switching required in surviving as a nanny. Her eyes flash with righteous fury as the leering lens of nanny-cams pop up around her. A score of skittering bugs and human groans plays as a perfect backdrop to a downward spiral, slippery and spooky. With a climax that hits as hard as a tidal wave, Nanny is a crowd-pleaser. It's little wonder it took home the U.S. Grand Jury Prize in the Dramatic Competition slate at Sundance. Whether you relish thoughtful character studies or the treacherous terrains found in horror, you'll want to seek this one out. — Kristy Puchko, Deputy Entertainment Editor (*)\nHow to watch: Nanny hits theaters Nov. 23 and is available for streaming on Prime Video Dec. 16.\nMovies\nArgentina, 1985 (In theaters 9/30, on Prime Video 10/21)\nCatherine Called Birdy (In theaters 9/23, on Prime Video 10/7)\nFlight/Risk (On Prime Video 9/9)\nGood Night Oppy (In theaters 11/4, on Prime Video 11/23)\nGoodnight Mommy (On Prime Video 9/16)\nMy Best Friend's Exorcism (On Prime Video 9/30)\nMy Policeman (In theaters 10/21, on Prime Video on 11/4)\nNanny (In theaters 11/23, on Prime Video on 12/16)\nRun Sweetheart Run (On Prime Video 10/28)\nSamaritan (On Prime Video 8/26)\nSomething From Tiffany's (On Prime Video 12/9)\nThe People We Hate at the Wedding (On Prime Video 11/18)\nWildcat (In theaters 12/21, on Prime Video 12/30)\n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            11 best new movies on Prime Video to watch this weekend\n                            \n                    \n    \nAsterisks (*) indicate the entry comes from a previous Mashable article.","provider":"Mashable"},{"title":"Amazon brings the mall to you with same-day GNC, PacSun deliveries","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/1/23287132/amazon-same-day-mall-retail-pacsun-gnc-superdry-diesel","date":"2022-08-01 16:42:20","content":"Image: Amazon\n    \n\n  \nAmazon is partnering with select stores that we’re used to seeing in local shopping malls to offer same-day Prime deliveries.

First, it came for Facebook and Instagram. Next up: Spotify.\nThe video app already has a strong hold over what music flourishes and what music fails in 2022. So it isn't particularly surprising that TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, filed a trademark application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for \"TikTok Music\" in May, according to patent filings uncovered by Insider.\nTikTok Music would let people buy, play, share, and download music, and create, share, and recommend playlists. Sounds a lot like all of the features we love about Spotify! The main difference, it seems, is that you'll also be able to comment on music and livestream audio and video, according to the filing.\nBut Spotify will be a tough app to beat, even by a behemoth like TikTok. While other apps and platforms faltered, Spotify has maintained a \"healthy\" and \"strong\" music advertising and podcast ad growth, according to Bloomberg.

As a fan for nearly 15 years, I had considered purchasing tickets when Paramore announced their tour earlier this month. However, my hopes were quickly crushed when I logged onto Twitter and saw Paramore trending: Within minutes of Ticketmaster opening the sale, most of the tickets were sold out before fans were able to purchase them. \nEven more discouraging: Those freshly sold tickets were being immediately listed for resale on Ticketmaster. And their prices were drastically higher than the original ticket prices — ranging from $300 to a whopping $8,000 per ticket. \n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\nAs of right now, the only tour stop of the 12 dates spared from ticket resellers is the Oct. 14 show in Bonner Springs, Kansas, for which tickets are still available as low as $36. The rest of the shows are either sold out or only have the more expensive resale tickets available for purchase. Quite understandably, Paramore fans are frustrated that Ticketmaster resales are throwing otherwise affordable concert tickets out of their budgets, preventing them from seeing Paramore on tour again for the first time since 2018. \n“After two years of turmoil and stress and lack of live music, it was exciting for me to have the opportunity to see my favorite band again,” Bailey Sandin, a DJ at CD 92.9 FM and long-time Paramore fan, told Mashable. “But to be locked out and quite frankly, not be able to afford tickets because of Ticketmaster’s lack of actual policy that helps the average concertgoer, and because of scalpers and box and people easily gaming the system, I can’t go. And I’m not special, I’m not the only one.”\nSandin was selected by Ticketmaster for the presale as part of the company’s Verified Fan feature, which was created to prevent bots from obtaining tickets before fans did. However, despite logging on at 10:10 a.m. (the Verified Fan presale ticket began at 10 a.m.), Sandin and many other fans were unable to obtain tickets before resellers did. Fans took to Twitter to express their frustration with Ticketmaster:\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\n\"This is not just a matter of ‘Oh, I can’t see my favorite band,’” said Sandin. “This is a matter of locking out an entire demographic, an entire group of people from enjoying the great equalizer, which is music. Music and concerts shouldn't be luxuries that make you go bankrupt.”\nIt's not the first time that fans have had difficulties obtaining tickets through Ticketmaster. It happens for nearly every in-demand tour. In early July, people were similarly unable to afford Bruce Springsteen concert tickets — which were going as high as $4,000 because of Ticketmaster’s “Official Platinum” feature that adjusts ticket prices in real time based on demand. According to Michael Rapino, the chief executive officer of Live Nation Entertainment (which is the parent company of Ticketmaster), the dynamic pricing feature is intended to reflect both the true value of the tickets and help artists maximize their profits from ticket sales. \n“We’re the only product out there that is worth more the second it’s sold,” said Rapino in an interview for the podcast The Compound & Friends in May. “Generally in business, you just actually price to the market, but we’re dealing with the artist brand and what makes sense.” \nWhile the feature is helping artists make more money from tours, they’re unfortunately doing so at the expense of their fans. In March 2022, John Oliver broke down why Ticketmaster is so disliked by consumers, with reasons varying from ticket scalpers who snatch up tickets and resell them, to the musical artists who only allot a small number of tickets to the public directly. Ticketmaster did not respond to Mashable at the time of publication.\n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            John Oliver breaks down why Ticketmaster sucks so much\n                            \n                    \n    \nDespite a large number of Paramore fans unable to obtain tickets to see their favorite band on tour again, this most recent Ticketmaster debacle is a reminder of the strength of the fandom. Some fans that were selected for the Verified Fan feature offered up their extra presale codes if they were buying less than the limit of four tickets, while others are selling their extra tickets at face value, ensuring that at least some folks who were locked out of the Ticketmaster sale would be able to attend one of the shows.\nSandin hopes that in the future, Ticketmaster puts a cap on the price of resale tickets, so that more people are able to purchase tickets at an affordable price. A few bands have been known to combat Ticketmaster’s selling practices, notoriously Pearl Jam until just recently, to discourage reselling at steep prices. Unfortunately, it seems as though most venues and artists seem to go with Ticketmaster because of its variable pricing model. And that model is intended to price out scalpers by selling tickets at a more premium price point. However, it only makes Ticketmaster seem like the real scalpers. \nGiven the state of Ticketmaster's system, it's easy for fans to feel powerless. But there are some independent resale marketplaces trying to put fans first. Sites like Twickets and Ticketpass claim to be more ethical through fairer reselling models and donating ticket profits to charities. Still, that does little to assuage fans' ticketing anxiety. \n“It's heartbreaking to me because live music is an experience where you can just stand and scream into the void, and everyone in that stadium is your best friend for those three, four hours that you're there. I just hate seeing the average person being locked out of that,” said Sandin. “Life is hard enough and we just went through a hell of a two years. The very least you should be able to scream your little heart out to ‘Hard Times.’”","provider":"Mashable"},{"title":"Snag an iPad on sale just in time for back-to-school season","link":"https://mashable.com/deals/aug-1-ipad","date":"2022-08-01 14:58:21","content":"Save $30: The ninth-generation iPad is only $299 at Amazon: 9% off its usual $329.

Its A13 Bionic chip means it's fast, its starting storage of 64GB means you probably won't have to be selective about the apps you download, and its 10.2-inch Retina display means you won't feel cramped when taking notes or like you're lugging another laptop around.\n\n    \n \n                    \n                        Opens in a new tab\n                    \n                \nCredit: Apple\n                            \n  \n            \n(opens in a new tab)\n        \n                    \n$299 at Amazon (save $30)\nGet Deal\n            (opens in a new tab)","provider":"Mashable"},{"title":"What will it take to reignite the NFT market?","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/01/what-will-it-take-to-reignite-the-nft-market/","date":"2022-08-01 14:55:07","content":"It seemed doubtful that the period of hype that gave us endless Bored Ape derivatives would last forever.

According to Mashable tech reporter Alex Perry, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better option than last month's $449 Google Pixel 6a.\n\"Google has once again made a premium experience affordable,\" Perry wrote in a glowing review. \"It may not be novel (and is in fact expected each year now), but that doesn’t make it any less praiseworthy.\"\nExtra praiseworthy is the fact that Amazon will give you a $50 gift card when you order the Pixel 6a there (as of Aug. 1).

Those downgrades may seem like dealbreakers, but Perry said they're merely \"mild compromises\" in the grand scheme of things — especially when you factor in the silky smooth performance of the phone's Tensor chip, its all-day battery life, and its extremely reasonable price point.\n\"[Pound] for pound, the Pixel 6a is the Pixel to get right now, \" Perry said. \"Until the Pixel 7 launches later this year, anyway.\"\n\n    \n \n                    \n                        Opens in a new tab\n                    \n                \nCredit: Google / Amazon\n                            \n  \n            \n(opens in a new tab)\n        \n                    \n$449 at Amazon\nGet Deal\n            (opens in a new tab)","provider":"Mashable"},{"title":"Netflix's 'I Came By' trailer weaves suspense around a High Court judge","link":"https://mashable.com/video/netflix-i-came-by-trailer","date":"2022-08-01 14:11:42","content":"Under the Shadow director Babak Anvari is back with a Netflix political thriller that digs into the secrets of the ruling class.

Steve Moser, iOS developer and writer at MacRumors, noticed that the iOS 16 developer beta 4, Apple Pay is available in Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. According to this Reddit thread, it's also available in Firefox. \nThis is only the case on iOS; Moser noticed that Apple Pay doesn't work in Edge or Chrome on the desktop, likely because the desktop browsers use their own web render engines, whereas the iOS versions use Safari's render engine. \n9to5Mac noted (via The Register) that this could be Apple's reaction to Europe’s upcoming Digital Markets Act, which prohibits \"gatekeepers\" such as Apple to control which features show up and which don't in third party browsers that use Apple's rendering engine. \n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            Did you know that Apple's App Store has ads?

You've probably heard the toilet seat analogies before: The average phone is anywhere from seven to 10 times dirtier than most porcelain thrones, depending on who you ask, and one in six is supposedly contaminated with fecal matter. (Truly sinister stuff.) If you're checking your phone as often as most people — that is, about once every 10 minutes — that's a lot of exposure to a lot of bacteria.\nIf your phone's starting to get gross, Apple, Google, and major Android manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Huawei, and Motorola all recommend swabbing it down with a soft, lint-free cloth, a hint of warm, soapy water, and a dab of rubbing alcohol. But as with cleaning any electronic device, this requires an extremely careful hand: Any excess moisture will do some serious damage if it gets into a port or crack. (Take it from someone who ruined an Xbox controller this way: It doesn't take much.) You also risk stripping the screen's protective coating, which makes it more prone to smudges and fingerprints.\nConsider, too, that you really have no way of telling whether you missed a spot when you give your phone a quick wipe-down — those poop germs could still be chilling there while you text, talk, and watch TikTok. There's got to be a better way, right?\nThat's the general idea behind ultraviolet (UV) phone sanitizers, anyway.\nWhat is a UV phone sanitizer, exactly?\nSanitizing devices that use UV light to kill pathogens and superbugs have been around in the medical field for decades now, but consumer-friendly adaptations are a more recent development and have gained significant popularity amid the COVID-19 pandemic. (See also: UV air purifiers and UV sanitizing wands.) \nA UV phone sanitizer is essentially just a small plastic or metal box containing a couple of UV bulbs or lamps, which shine onto your device during the disinfection cycle. Aside from avoiding moisture, fumes, and residue, the most obvious draw is the sheer convenience factor: You just pop your phone into the sanitizer's chamber, close its lid, and let it do its thing for about five to ten minutes.\nFor best results, make sure you take your device out of its case before sanitizing it — you can run that through separately afterward. (Other small objects like PopSockets, keys, credit cards, glasses, smartwatches, and earbuds should fit in there, too.)\nHow does UV light kill germs?\nUV light is a form of electromagnetic radiation you usually encounter in the form of sunlight, though it can also be recreated using artificial light sources. There are three different types of UV rays:\n\nUV-A rays have the longest wavelengths. You'll find these in tanning beds, bug zappers, and in the blacklights of your local club.\n\nUV-B rays have slightly shorter wavelengths. These can help skin produce Vitamin D3 (but may also cause sunburn) and are mostly used in tanning beds alongside UV-A radiation.\n\nUV-C rays have the shortest wavelengths. These are typically used for disinfection purposes, as they can damage microbes' DNA. This either kills them outright or prevents them from functioning and reproducing.\n\nNote: All mentions of UV light hereafter refer to UV-C rays specifically.\nIs UV light dangerous?\nUV light is far more dangerous to a microbe than a human being, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration still recommends exercising some caution around it: \"Direct exposure of skin and eyes to UV-C radiation from some UVC lamps may cause painful eye injury and burn-like skin reactions. Never look directly at a UVC lamp source, even briefly.\" \nThe FDA further notes that UV light can degrade plastic and polymers, but fret not: You'd need hours of continuous exposure to do any notable damage to your phone.\nDo UV phone sanitizers really work?\nPCMag's consumer electronics analyst Steven Winkelman has already tackled this topic in a thorough explainer. (PCMag is owned by Mashable's published, Ziff Davis.) We won't rehash the whole thing, but the gist of it is this: Kind of. \nWhile UV light itself is really good at eliminating and stopping the spread of certain bacteria (including E. coli and Salmonella), the kinds of UV sanitizers being sold to the public are pretty dinky compared to the ones used in hospitals.\n\"Many of the UVC lamps sold for home use are of low dose,\" the FDA says, \"so it may take longer exposure to a given surface area to potentially provide effective inactivation of a bacteria or virus.\"\nTo that end, it's also important to note that while most manufacturers say their phone sanitizers are 99.99% effective against common germs, very few can back up their claims with third-party lab testing.\nWe already know that hand-washing, wearing masks, social distancing, and getting vaccinated are quite good at keeping us germ-free — and those methods are all free or extremely cheap. All things considered, UV sanitation should be your \"second line of defense\" against viruses and bacteria, Winkelman says. \nAre UV sanitizers effective against COVID-19?\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have confirmed that UV light is capable of destroying SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, but that also comes with a pretty big caveat: No consumer-grade phone sanitizers have been lab-tested against COVID, even the rare few that have undergone testing against other germs. \nKeep in mind, too, that COVID is primarily an airborne virus. \"[Studies] show the virus is rarely viable on surfaces,\" Winkelman writes, \"and the CDC states that transmission from contaminated surfaces 'is not thought to be a common way that COVID-19 spreads.'\"\nIf you're thinking about getting a UV sanitizer for the sole purpose of protecting yourself from COVID, you're probably better off with a face mask or respirator and a Moderna or Pfizer jab.\nWhat's the best UV phone sanitizer?\nIf your ears perked up at that previous mention of PhoneSoap, it's either because you caught its Shark Tank episode back in 2015, you heard about its partnership with Otterbox, or just because it's easily the biggest name on the market. The company sells a wide range of UV sanitizing devices that have all undergone extensive lab testing, including several full-featured phone sanitizers with built-in chargers, special acoustic outlets that let you hear notifications, and antimicrobial cables. \nFor these reasons, we recommend PhoneSoap's products above all others for most use cases.

That doesn't mean you have to settle for a basic keyboard though.\nWhile gaming keyboard brands offer similar features, serious gamers know what sets the best keyboards apart — the kinds of features that can help you reach your peak gaming potential.\nNot everyone is a gaming expert, of course, so for those who aren't in the know, we've lined up a quick guide on gaming keyboards to help you can make an informed purchase decision.\nWhy do you need a gaming keyboard?\nIf you're a casual gamer who only plays from time to time, you are probably going to be just fine with a standard keyboard. If you're a serious gamer who regularly engages in competitive matches, an upgrade could make a big difference to your experience.\nAlongside your mouse, a gaming keyboard is the accessory you are going to interact with more than anything else. So it pays to upgrade to something special. The best gaming keyboards are more responsive and can react more quickly to give you an edge. When the difference between success and failure can come down to split seconds, it's clear what impact these devices can have on your win rate. \nWhat are the most important features in a gaming keyboard?\nThese are the most important factors when it comes to picking a gaming keyboard:\nSwitches — Keyboard switches (the bits that sit underneath each key) pick up what you put down. Most gaming keyboards come equipped with one of a variety of different options for mechanical or membrane switches. The switches register your keystroke, so you want to make sure they function with speed and accuracy.\nType — Mechanical keyboards are sturdier, offer a more instant reaction, and tend to be the preferred option for gamers. Membrane keyboards are ideal for quieter performance and quicker movement across the keys. \nAnti-ghosting — Anti-ghosting technology (basically the ability to capture simultaneous keystrokes without any hiccups) has become a standard on gaming keyboards, and all the gaming keyboards highlighted below come equipped with some form of anti-ghosting technology. The difference between the keyboards is the number of anti-ghosting keys that can be used simultaneously, as some keyboards are more restrictive than others.\nBacklighting — Gaming keyboards come equipped with either single colour backlighting, multi-colour RGB (Red, Green, Blue) backlighting, or no lighting at all. Some gaming keyboards even feature backlighting options that allow you to synchronise the lighting with the action on your screen to create the ultimate gaming atmosphere. \nAdditional features you should consider include ergonomics, customisable macros, and design. The first step is to determine what your gaming priorities are, and whether they are specific to your favourite game or are more in line with budget or versatility. Then use this guide to pinpoint the perfect gaming keyboard to meet your unique gaming needs. \nWhat is the best gaming keyboard?\nWe've looked at the key features, along with style, feel, and cost, to bring you a selection of your best options from top gaming brands like Razer and Corsair. We recommend that you check out everything in this list, and consider what will work best for you and your gaming world.\nThese are the best gaming keyboards in 2022.","provider":"Mashable"},{"title":"Gig Workers Are Losing Their Hard-Won Rights","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/gig-workers-rights-rollback-france/","date":"2022-08-01 11:00:00","content":"A battle between unions and Just Eat France sets a troubling precedent for platform workers.","provider":"Wired"},{"title":"There’s a Monkeypox Testing Bottleneck","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/theres-a-monkeypox-testing-bottleneck/","date":"2022-08-01 11:00:00","content":"US testing capacity has ramped up, but the process is ponderous, and not everyone who needs a test is getting one.","provider":"Wired"},{"title":"The Age of Brain-Computer Interfaces Is on the Horizon","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/synchron-brain-computer-interface/","date":"2022-08-01 11:00:00","content":"Synchron has implanted its BCI in a US patient for the first time—bringing it a big step closer to distribution.","provider":"Wired"},{"title":"How to Set Medication Reminders on Your Phone","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-set-medication-reminders-on-phones/","date":"2022-08-01 11:00:00","content":"Don’t forget your pills!
