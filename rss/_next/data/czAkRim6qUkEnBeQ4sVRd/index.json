Steve Moser, iOS developer and writer at MacRumors, noticed that the iOS 16 developer beta 4, Apple Pay is available in Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. According to this Reddit thread, it's also available in Firefox. \nThis is only the case on iOS; Moser noticed that Apple Pay doesn't work in Edge or Chrome on the desktop, likely because the desktop browsers use their own web render engines, whereas the iOS versions use Safari's render engine. \n9to5Mac noted (via The Register) that this could be Apple's reaction to Europe’s upcoming Digital Markets Act, which prohibits \"gatekeepers\" such as Apple to control which features show up and which don't in third party browsers that use Apple's rendering engine. \n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            Did you know that Apple's App Store has ads?

You've probably heard the toilet seat analogies before: The average phone is anywhere from seven to 10 times dirtier than most porcelain thrones, depending on who you ask, and one in six is supposedly contaminated with fecal matter. (Truly sinister stuff.) If you're checking your phone as often as most people — that is, about once every 10 minutes — that's a lot of exposure to a lot of bacteria.\nIf your phone's starting to get gross, Apple, Google, and major Android manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Huawei, and Motorola all recommend swabbing it down with a soft, lint-free cloth, a hint of warm, soapy water, and a dab of rubbing alcohol. But as with cleaning any electronic device, this requires an extremely careful hand: Any excess moisture will do some serious damage if it gets into a port or crack. (Take it from someone who ruined an Xbox controller this way: It doesn't take much.) You also risk stripping the screen's protective coating, which makes it more prone to smudges and fingerprints.\nConsider, too, that you really have no way of telling whether you missed a spot when you give your phone a quick wipe-down — those poop germs could still be chilling there while you text, talk, and watch TikTok. There's got to be a better way, right?\nThat's the general idea behind ultraviolet (UV) phone sanitizers, anyway.\nWhat is a UV phone sanitizer, exactly?\nSanitizing devices that use UV light to kill pathogens and superbugs have been around in the medical field for decades now, but consumer-friendly adaptations are a more recent development and have gained significant popularity amid the COVID-19 pandemic. (See also: UV air purifiers and UV sanitizing wands.) \nA UV phone sanitizer is essentially just a small plastic or metal box containing a couple of UV bulbs or lamps, which shine onto your device during the disinfection cycle. Aside from avoiding moisture, fumes, and residue, the most obvious draw is the sheer convenience factor: You just pop your phone into the sanitizer's chamber, close its lid, and let it do its thing for about five to ten minutes.\nFor best results, make sure you take your device out of its case before sanitizing it — you can run that through separately afterward. (Other small objects like PopSockets, keys, credit cards, glasses, smartwatches, and earbuds should fit in there, too.)\nHow does UV light kill germs?\nUV light is a form of electromagnetic radiation you usually encounter in the form of sunlight, though it can also be recreated using artificial light sources. There are three different types of UV rays:\n\nUV-A rays have the longest wavelengths. You'll find these in tanning beds, bug zappers, and in the blacklights of your local club.\n\nUV-B rays have slightly shorter wavelengths. These can help skin produce Vitamin D3 (but may also cause sunburn) and are mostly used in tanning beds alongside UV-A radiation.\n\nUV-C rays have the shortest wavelengths. These are typically used for disinfection purposes, as they can damage microbes' DNA. This either kills them outright or prevents them from functioning and reproducing.\n\nNote: All mentions of UV light hereafter refer to UV-C rays specifically.\nIs UV light dangerous?\nUV light is far more dangerous to a microbe than a human being, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration still recommends exercising some caution around it: \"Direct exposure of skin and eyes to UV-C radiation from some UVC lamps may cause painful eye injury and burn-like skin reactions. Never look directly at a UVC lamp source, even briefly.\" \nThe FDA further notes that UV light can degrade plastic and polymers, but fret not: You'd need hours of continuous exposure to do any notable damage to your phone.\nDo UV phone sanitizers really work?\nPCMag's consumer electronics analyst Steven Winkelman has already tackled this topic in a thorough explainer. (PCMag is owned by Mashable's published, Ziff Davis.) We won't rehash the whole thing, but the gist of it is this: Kind of. \nWhile UV light itself is really good at eliminating and stopping the spread of certain bacteria (including E. coli and Salmonella), the kinds of UV sanitizers being sold to the public are pretty dinky compared to the ones used in hospitals.\n\"Many of the UVC lamps sold for home use are of low dose,\" the FDA says, \"so it may take longer exposure to a given surface area to potentially provide effective inactivation of a bacteria or virus.\"\nTo that end, it's also important to note that while most manufacturers say their phone sanitizers are 99.99% effective against common germs, very few can back up their claims with third-party lab testing.\nWe already know that hand-washing, wearing masks, social distancing, and getting vaccinated are quite good at keeping us germ-free — and those methods are all free or extremely cheap. All things considered, UV sanitation should be your \"second line of defense\" against viruses and bacteria, Winkelman says. \nAre UV sanitizers effective against COVID-19?\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have confirmed that UV light is capable of destroying SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, but that also comes with a pretty big caveat: No consumer-grade phone sanitizers have been lab-tested against COVID, even the rare few that have undergone testing against other germs. \nKeep in mind, too, that COVID is primarily an airborne virus. \"[Studies] show the virus is rarely viable on surfaces,\" Winkelman writes, \"and the CDC states that transmission from contaminated surfaces 'is not thought to be a common way that COVID-19 spreads.'\"\nIf you're thinking about getting a UV sanitizer for the sole purpose of protecting yourself from COVID, you're probably better off with a face mask or respirator and a Moderna or Pfizer jab.\nWhat's the best UV phone sanitizer?\nIf your ears perked up at that previous mention of PhoneSoap, it's either because you caught its Shark Tank episode back in 2015, you heard about its partnership with Otterbox, or just because it's easily the biggest name on the market. The company sells a wide range of UV sanitizing devices that have all undergone extensive lab testing, including several full-featured phone sanitizers with built-in chargers, special acoustic outlets that let you hear notifications, and antimicrobial cables. \nFor these reasons, we recommend PhoneSoap's products above all others for most use cases. (There are a few exceptions.)

That doesn't mean you have to settle for a basic keyboard though.\nWhile gaming keyboard brands offer similar features, serious gamers know what sets the best keyboards apart — the kinds of features that can help you reach your peak gaming potential.\nNot everyone is a gaming expert, of course, so for those who aren't in the know, we've lined up a quick guide on gaming keyboards to help you can make an informed purchase decision.\nWhy do you need a gaming keyboard?\nIf you're a casual gamer who only plays from time to time, you are probably going to be just fine with a standard keyboard. If you're a serious gamer who regularly engages in competitive matches, an upgrade could make a big difference to your experience.\nAlongside your mouse, a gaming keyboard is the accessory you are going to interact with more than anything else. So it pays to upgrade to something special. The best gaming keyboards are more responsive and can react more quickly to give you an edge. When the difference between success and failure can come down to split seconds, it's clear what impact these devices can have on your win rate. \nWhat are the most important features in a gaming keyboard?\nThese are the most important factors when it comes to picking a gaming keyboard:\nSwitches — Keyboard switches (the bits that sit underneath each key) pick up what you put down. Most gaming keyboards come equipped with one of a variety of different options for mechanical or membrane switches. The switches register your keystroke, so you want to make sure they function with speed and accuracy.\nType — Mechanical keyboards are sturdier, offer a more instant reaction, and tend to be the preferred option for gamers. Membrane keyboards are ideal for quieter performance and quicker movement across the keys. \nAnti-ghosting — Anti-ghosting technology (basically the ability to capture simultaneous keystrokes without any hiccups) has become a standard on gaming keyboards, and all the gaming keyboards highlighted below come equipped with some form of anti-ghosting technology. The difference between the keyboards is the number of anti-ghosting keys that can be used simultaneously, as some keyboards are more restrictive than others.\nBacklighting — Gaming keyboards come equipped with either single colour backlighting, multi-colour RGB (Red, Green, Blue) backlighting, or no lighting at all. Some gaming keyboards even feature backlighting options that allow you to synchronise the lighting with the action on your screen to create the ultimate gaming atmosphere. \nAdditional features you should consider include ergonomics, customisable macros, and design. The first step is to determine what your gaming priorities are, and whether they are specific to your favourite game or are more in line with budget or versatility. Then use this guide to pinpoint the perfect gaming keyboard to meet your unique gaming needs. \nWhat is the best gaming keyboard?\nWe've looked at the key features, along with style, feel, and cost, to bring you a selection of your best options from top gaming brands like Razer and Corsair. We recommend that you check out everything in this list, and consider what will work best for you and your gaming world.\nThese are the best gaming keyboards in 2022.","provider":"Mashable"},{"title":"Gig Workers Are Losing Their Hard-Won Rights","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/gig-workers-rights-rollback-france/","date":"2022-08-01 11:00:00","content":"A battle between unions and Just Eat France sets a troubling precedent for platform workers.","provider":"Wired"},{"title":"There’s a Monkeypox Testing Bottleneck","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/theres-a-monkeypox-testing-bottleneck/","date":"2022-08-01 11:00:00","content":"US testing capacity has ramped up, but the process is ponderous, and not everyone who needs a test is getting one.","provider":"Wired"},{"title":"The Age of Brain-Computer Interfaces Is on the Horizon","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/synchron-brain-computer-interface/","date":"2022-08-01 11:00:00","content":"Synchron has implanted its BCI in a US patient for the first time—bringing it a big step closer to distribution.","provider":"Wired"},{"title":"How to Set Medication Reminders on Your Phone","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-set-medication-reminders-on-phones/","date":"2022-08-01 11:00:00","content":"Don’t forget your pills!

A PC or console, of course. That's an absolute must. A monitor, a comfy chair, and — last but certainly not least — a gaming mouse. Not just any old mouse, but a good quality gaming mouse.\nSerious gamers know that a good gaming mouse is absolutely necessary. This basic computer accessory has become more sophisticated over the years. It has evolved to keep up with the needs of gamers and the evolution of gaming tech. \nBut how to choose a gaming mouse? With so many different options and specs out there, it's easy to get blinded by jargon or too many options. That's why we're here to help. Here's a guide to the need-to-know information.\nDo you need a gaming mouse?\nIf you're serious about gaming, yes. A regular mouse just won't cut it. \nA gaming mouse will have sensors that are designed to be more responsive and more accurate than your average computer mouse. This means that a good gaming mouse will improve your aim and respond better to your reflexes. They also have programmable buttons that you can customise so you don’t have to ever use your keyboard when you’re chasing that all-important kill-streak. \nThe difference between winning and losing in PC gaming can come down to split seconds, so having a gaming mouse that reacts and responds quickly is absolutely vital. Using a gaming mouse means being better equipped for success. \nWhat are the most important features in a gaming mouse?\nThere's a long list of things to keep in mind when shopping for a gaming mouse, but we've tried to highlight the most important features:\nComfort — Since you’re probably going to spend hours playing your favourite games, you'll want something that’s comfortable in your hand. Gaming mice come in lots of shapes, sizes, widths, and weights. Pick one that feels right for you. What feels comfortable to one gamer might not for another. For example, some are also designed with left-handed gamers in mind. \nDPI — You’ll also want to pay attention to Dots Per Inch, or DPI. This is how sensitive your mouse is to movements. You can find mice with DPI counts up to 20,000, though most gamers don’t need something quite that sensitive. Anything over 2,000 is considered pretty good. \nWired/wireless — Wireless mice used to be less accurate and slower than wired ones, but recent changes in technology have made them incredibly competitive. Still, you should know that wireless mice generally cost more.

There's one in Australia called Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of a Tony Hawk Pro Skater Cover Band. And there's one in the UK called The 900 (sharing a name with Hawk's famous landing of the first-ever 900 at the 1999 X Games in San Francisco), who will be adding quite the feather to their cap after one hell of a cameo at a set on Saturday.\nTony Hawk himself showed up to The 900's gig at Signature Brew Haggerston to sing with the band. They played a couple of songs, including Agent Orange's \"Bloodstains,\" which featured in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4.

It already features some ads, but soon it will have even more. \nAccording to 9to5Mac, Apple's App Store will soon start featuring ads on its Today tab, which functions as the App Store's homepage — it's the first thing you see when you fire it up. The ads will show in the second slot, so they'll be immediately visible when you open the App Store. \nAdditionally, ads are coming to product pages. App developers will be able to buy advertising slots on the bottom of other Apps' pages. They won't be able to target specific products directly, but the ads will show up on relevant product pages. This might lead to some confusion, for example when a direct competitor shows up as an ad in another app's product page.\nThese new ads are on top of the ads that already show up in App Store, namely in the Search tab, and on top of Search results. The ads aren't easy to spot if you're not actively looking for them; they're identifiable by slightly lighter background and a small badge saying \"Ad\" just beneath the app's description. \n\n    \nWhen you search for Lightroom, the first thing that shows up is an ad.

Yes, it's a pretty picture — but what about the sounds? The only thing that could make this image even more perfect would be having an excellent speaker at your side, pumping out your favourite tunes.\nWhen you’re selecting a speaker for this scene, there are a few features you’re going to want to prioritise. Choosing a wireless speaker — one that doesn’t tangle you in power cords and can easily connect to your phone via WiFi or Bluetooth — can definitely make things easier, which is why you should only consider a wireless speaker for outside use.\nWireless technology isn't the only feature that you need for an outdoor speaker. Also important for outdoor use is some kind of weather-resistance or waterproofing. There are other things to consider too, so here's a guide to everything you need to know.\nWhat are the benefits of a wireless outdoor speaker?\nWith today’s WiFi and Bluetooth technology, there’s no need to fumble with complicated installations and worry about safely burying wires outside in all the wet and windy elements. You’re better off with a Bluetooth speaker that easily connects to your devices — smartphone, tablet, laptop, whatever — and seamlessly streams your tunes. \nAnother benefit is that you can often link several of them together via Bluetooth to provide complete audio coverage across your outdoor space. You can also use that tech to sync the audio playing indoors and outdoors to keep your party’s vibe consistent.\nWhat are the important features in wireless outdoor speakers?\nWe have checked out a wide range of wireless outdoor speakers, and come up with a shortlist of things you should care about. These are the most important things to consider: \nSound quality — Just like with any speaker purchase, you’re going to want to prioritise sound quality. What’s the point if your speaker doesn’t play your tunes any better than your phone? So make sure you pick something with bass, clear audio, and good volume. \nDurability — This might seem obvious, but you need your outdoor speaker to be durable. If it's not, then it's not going to last very long. Chances are, any outdoor speaker is going to take a few bumps and it might even get dropped. So the last thing you need is something that easily breaks. \nWeather-resistance — Of course, nothing is indestructible in the elements, but you will need something that can hold up at least for a little while in whatever weather conditions are common near you. This is where a speaker that's water or heat resistant can come in handy.\nWaterproofing — We have just mentioned how important water resistance is, but you should also look for the next step in protection. If you’re planning to use your speaker near a pool, lake, or sea, you should get one that can be submerged in water. Accidents happen, and it's best to play it safe with a waterproof speaker.\nBattery Life — The major downside of wireless speakers is that they need to be charged periodically. Make sure that the outdoor speaker you choose has a decent battery life if you plan to use it often and don’t want to think about recharging too much. 10-12 hours is about average.\nDo wireless speakers have voice assistants?\nAnother reason to go for a wireless outdoor speaker is that some are compatible with the voice assistants you already own, like Google Home or Amazon’s line of Alexa-enabled Echo devices. Imagine just telling your speakers to play your favourite song. That’s not just wireless, but touchless too.

The countless TikToks, YouTube videos, and its near-constant sold out status made me believe Dyson has actually hit hair gold. \nThen, considering I'm reviewing the new iteration of the Dyson Airwrap that launched in June, I imagined I'd be using an improved version of what already seemed to be a well-liked product worth the hype. And I love my Dyson vacuum, so my hopes were pretty high.\nAs it turns out, the Dyson Airwrap Complete multi-styler is just fine. \n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            8 Dyson Airwrap dupes you can buy for under $200\n                            \n                    \n    \nI'm not here to create controversy (sounds like something someone trying to create controversy would say, but stay with me). With that said, minus a few (albeit major) parts of the styler, nothing really wowed me. At least, nothing that would make me happy to hand over $600.  \nNow with that said, I do think a lot of the Dyson Airwrap's worth lies in what you want out of a styler, and what your hair is bringing to the party. I tested every single attachment over the course of a few weeks, and I certainly have some thoughts, so let's get into it. \nWhat exactly is new about the new Dyson Airwrap? \nIf you consult the Airwrap page on Dyson's website, you'll see a \"latest technology\" flag to let you know this is the new Airwrap (that, and the first generation one is no longer available on the site). So what does that new technology bring? \nThe Coanda air tech (this is the fancy term that describes how the tool relies on air rather than heat to style) from the original Airwrap is back again, but with attachments meant to optimize its use. \nThis new iteration also comes in three models: the Dyson Airwrap Complete for short- to medium-length hair, the Dyson Airwrap Complete Long for hair that's chest-length or longer (this is the model I tested), and the Dyson Airwrap Complete Coily/Curly for, you guessed it, coily and curly hair. \nThe Complete Long comes with six attachments: \n\nCoanda smoothing dryer\n\n1.2-inch Airwrap long barrel \n\n1.6-inch Airwrap long barrel\n\nFirm smoothing brush\n\nSoft smoothing brush \n\nRound volumizing brush \n\nAll of these attachments come in a large storage case a la the original Airwrap. Mine lived on the floor next to my desk during the duration of my testing, since my bathroom simply did not have the space to accommodate it. \n\n    \nWhere I stored my Dyson Airwrap case, with IKEA drawers for size reference.  \n            Credit: Mashable / Bethany Allard \n        \nThe biggest attachment upgrades \nWhen it comes to what's noticeably improved, the attachments are by far the standouts. \nDirection changing curling barrels\nMaybe the most obvious flaw of the first generation Airwrap was that to alternate the direction of your curls, you had to swap out your barrel, which meant if you didn't want perfectly uniform curls, you'd have to use two barrels while styling. \nThe new Airwrap provides a fix in the form of a switch at the tip of both the 1.2-inch and 1.6-inch barrels, which allows you to change the curl direction with a simple twist. I would probably be a better person if I had the kind of patience required to swap out a barrel every few sections of hair. Alas, I am who I am, and for that reason, I am very grateful I tested this generation of the Airwrap, and never once had to switch the attachment while styling my curls. \n\n    \nFor those of us without patience, Dyson provided a crucial fix on the curling attachment. \n            Credit: Mashable / Bethany Allard\n        \nThe dual purpose smoothing dryer attachment\nThe Coanda smoothing dryer was my sleeper hit of the updated Airwrap. While one end blows out a surprising amount of hot air for an overall dry, a quick twist redirects the air out of the smoothing end, which tames frizz as it dries and grabs sections of hair similar to the curling wand attachments. It actually worked great for smoothing sans any brushing, and it would dry my very long hair in 10 to 15 minutes. It's a definite step up from the pre-styling dryer that came with the first Airwrap. \n\n    \nThe new Dyson Airwrap smoothing attachment (left) replaces the pre-dry attachment (right) of the first generation Airwrap. \n            Credit: Mashable Photo Composite / Dyson\n        \nThere are also some slight design changes on the smoothing brushes, but nothing as significant as the above two attachments. \nFor owners of the first generation Airwrap who might be looking at the updated curling barrel and punching the air right now, I'm happy to report that all of these attachments are compatible with the new and older models. Each is available (when in stock at least) for $39.99. \nAnd as you would expect from a tool that costs this much, all the attachments snap into place easily and feel snug and firm when in use. \nStill, the Dyson Airwrap learning curve isn't nonexistent \nWhen I first tested the Revlon One-Step (the Dyson's classic point of comparison), I found it relatively easy to use, despite my middling hair styling skills. I expected much of the same with the Airwrap, especially as it's often treated as superior to the One-Step. \nThis held true when it came to every attachment but the curling barrels. The TikToks lied to you. It doesn't just grab the ends of your hair, easy-peasy, no matter where hair is sitting. I found that it was really important to grab the right sized section of hair, hold out it out from the rest of my head so the barrel didn't grab any extra hair, then let the ends hang limp so the styler would actually grab it.\n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            The Dyson Airwrap's secret sauce is jet engine tech\n                            \n                    \n    \nOnce I figured that out, it became much easier, but finding the right tension and sized section (which can be tricky with longer hair), takes some skill. \nThe curling attachment left much to be desired during and after the styling process\nBefore we even get into it, I want to be clear — I read the literature (Dyson's help guides), I delved into the texts (YouTube tutorials), I assembled my most trusted confidants (heat protectant, styling cream, and hair spray) — I could not get the curls from the Dyson Airwrap to last in my hair for a full calendar day. \nMaybe this could be forgiven in some cases, but styling these curls takes a good chunk of time, especially if you have longer and thicker hair. The first time I used the 1.6-inch curling barrel, I took 30 minutes to curl my hair, and this was after the six minutes it took to bring my hair from towel dried to the 80 percent damp state that's recommended for curling the hair. \n\n    I read the literature (Dyson's help guides), I delved into the texts (YouTube tutorials), I assembled my most trusted confidants (heat protectant, styling cream, and hair spray) — I could not get the curls from the Dyson Airwrap to last in my hair for a full calendar day. \n    \n\nThat doesn't sound bad, but then I realized a decent chunk of curls had fallen while I'd been curling. So I went back in, and about 20 minutes later, it looked somewhat better. Overall, I spent about an hour in my bathroom, and a few hours later when I drove to a friend's birthday dinner, I realized the curls had mostly fallen. I had bouncy, flippy hair that was pretty, but not the loose waves I wanted.\n\n                \n1.6-inch barrel curls immediately after being styled.\n                                                                            Credit: Mashable / Bethany Allard \n                                            \n1.6-inch barrel curls about 4 and 1/2 hours later, in glorious car-selfie lighting.\n                                                                            Credit: Mashable / Bethany Allard\n                                            \nI decided that although the 1.6-inch barrel says it can achieve loose curls and waves, maybe for my hair, it would create more of a blowout-esque look. So, I turned to the 1.2-inch barrel. Again, I dutifully followed the steps Dyson recommends for curls: I sectioned my hair, blasted it with hot air for 10 to 15 seconds, then blasted it with cold air for an additional five to 10. I even did 20 to 25 seconds of hot air and 15 of cold, but my patience once again got in the way, and it didn't make too much of a difference in the end anyway. \n\n                \n1.2-inch barrel curls immediately after styling, giving some bottom-heavy volume realness. \n                                                                            Credit: Mashable / Bethany Allard\n                                            \nTwo hours later, these curls had fallen into very soft waves, with the middle of the hair straightening almost completely. \n                                                                            Credit: Mashable / Bethany Allard \n                                            \nReally, don't expect curls that'll last all day\nWhile I eventually got to the place where this process moved a bit faster, the curls still fell while I styled and continued to fall throughout the day. Forgoing hairspray (which I can sometimes do with a curling wand) wasn't an option if I wanted my style to last beyond an hour or two.\nIn fact, I found that styling one side, hair spraying it, then moving on to the other was key for longevity.\nSome people say that they can get the curls to last for more than one day — even with a classic wand frying my hair, this isn't possible for me, so I never had this expectation. However, watching the curls fall within the 45 minutes it took to style them — not once did I have to brush out even the most coiled Founding Father-esque curl — was a bit disappointing.\n\n                \nAfter much more practice, I was able to achieve prettier and more consistent curls. \n                                                                            Credit: Mashable / Bethany Allard\n                                            \nBut 30 minutes after styling, they had already started to fall slightly. By night time, only a slight wave remained. \n                                                                            Credit: Mashable / Bethany Allard\n                                            \nAs a fun experiment, my roommate also tested the curling barrel on freshly washed and 80 percent dried hair. Her hair, though incredibly straight, is happy to curl with a flat iron. Her hair is even longer than mine though, so she did struggle some to get it to wrap around the barrel at first. By the end of the experiment, her hair was pretty much straight again. For both of us, we found that our long hair meant that the curls, even when intact, were pretty bottom heavy, too. \n\n    \nMy roommate ended up re-curling her hair with a curling wand after her first attempt with the 1.6-inch barrel yielded these results.\n            Credit: Mashable / Bethany Allard \n        \nOne of the big draws you see about the Airwrap is the curling attachments, and they were certainly what I was most excited to try. Maybe it is just a matter of them not loving my hair type, or that I still have some learning to do, but in any case, they were by far the most disappointing part of the Dyson. \nHair-friendly heat styling is possible\nI know we just spent some time going over why the curling barrel was less than great, but what I will say was a huge plus, is that even through hour-long styling sessions, my hair never felt like it was taking on all that much heat damage.\nNot once did I smell that signature burned hair scent that accompanies the use of pretty much any hot tool, including the Revlon One-Step. This was true for every single attachment included with the Airwrap, which made me see why someone who regularly uses hot tools would want to pay to protect their hair a bit more. Sure, it might mean certain styles are locked in less, but for long term use, I definitely see the merit. \nThe Dyson also has great customizability when it comes to how much heat you want blasting your hair. In addition to the cool shot switch, there are three different heat levels, and three different air speed levels. All were easy to adjust mid-styling. \n\n    \nThe heat and air settings are easy to adjust mid-styling. \n            Credit: Mashable / Bethany Allard\n        \nAs an added bonus, every single time I styled my hair with this product, I got compliments, which is an especially nice feeling for someone who used to struggle brushing their hair when they were a kid. \nThe smoothing power is unreal\nSince my hair runs a little on the dry side, I'm no stranger to frizz. Though I've never been a fan of completely straightened styles on myself, and therefore usually let my waves air dry, I actually found myself most happy with my results when using any of the smoothing attachments. \nI've already spoken some about the new Coanda smoothing dryer, which was great for getting a quick, rough dry and flipping around to smooth out some frizz on the top of my head.\nThe attachments that surprised me the most with how much I liked them, especially since they looked the most boring, were the soft and firm smoothing brushes. Both are meant for straightening, but the firm brush has less flexible bristles meant to tame frizz a bit better. I used that one on the top layer of my hair where I get most frizzy, and the soft one for the rest of my head. By the end of styling, the frizz wasn't nonexistent, but it was way less than what I usually deal with. \n\n    \nThe two attachments that took me by surprise, the soft and firm smoothing brush (pictured left to right).\n            Credit: Mashable / Bethany Allard\n        \nIn both cases, they actually worked as well normal brushes, too. I never ran a comb through my hair beforehand, as I would with a round brush, and my tangles came out easily. \nWhat was also nice was that though I could get my hair perfectly straight, I could also brush through the very ends of my hair quicker to get it dry, but leave some of my natural wave. That gave me a look my roommate described as \"styled, but like you didn't style it at all,\" which is ultimately the Peak Goal of quick styling. And I do mean quick, since these brushes dried my hair in 10 minutes. Overall, it gave much more body and movement than a standard hair straightener. \n\n                \nMy hair went from towel dried to this in under 15 minutes thanks to the smoothing brushes.\n                                                                            Credit: Mashable / Bethany Allard\n                                            \nThe smoothing brushes tamed my frizz and gave me great volume at the root. \n                                                                            Credit: Mashable / Bethany Allard\n                                            \nThe attachment we've yet to talk about is the round volumizing brush. It's pretty standard, not too large, and does provide pretty flips at the end of the hair. As for the volume it provides at the root, I honestly got better results with the smoothing brushes somehow. This could be a learning curve thing, but it was also easier on early passes with the Revlon One-Step to get bigger volume due to the larger brush size, though the One-Step definitely introduces more heat damage.\n\n    \nThe Revlon One Step Plus round brush by far has the larger diameter. \n            Credit: Mashable / Bethany Allard \n        \nIs the new Dyson Airwrap worth it? \nIf you already own the Airwrap, you 100 percent do not need to upgrade. At the very least, grab a couple of new attachments, but save your money — you've already made the big investment.\nIn other cases, it depends. If you occasionally want a blowout look, the Revlon One-Step is fantastic and a fraction of the cost. Yes, you'll pay a bit with heat damage, but if you're not using it super frequently, it'll be okay. \nIf you just want great curls on some days, this might be a skip for you, too. Honestly, every time I curled my hair with the Airwrap, I thought about how much I would prefer using a Dyson blow dryer and then my classic curling wand, to achieve better results in less time.  \nWith that said, I could see this working great for people with shoulder length or shorter hair. The styling time would be cut in half, and the curls would probably take up more of the strand. As someone who's had shorter hair, I also know that some form of daily styling is usually necessary, so the plus of less damage isn't negligible. \nIf you are heat styling your hair every single day, this product could very well be worth it. The other important thing to note is that the Airwrap works best when you style from wet hair, so if you're not a morning shower-er, that's another big point to consider. It could just mean making a lifestyle change, but I'm personally a nighttime shower person in my heart of hearts, so I didn't love having to rewet my hair every morning. \nIt is, first and foremost, a luxury\nFor everybody else, unless you're really dying to spend $600, you don't need the Airwrap. It's fancy, it's fun, but you shouldn't expect (like I did) that it's going to drastically change the hair game. It has some huge benefits, but the price, time investment, and issues with the curling attachment kept it from completely blowing me away.","provider":"Mashable"},{"title":"How Some Parents Changed Their Politics in the Pandemic","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/01/technology/anti-vax-parents-political-party.html","date":"2022-08-01 07:00:16","content":"They were once Democrats and Republicans.

月新番动画《彻夜之歌》第一集？\n动作只留头尾，剪掉中间状态\n\n\n第一集开头的两个例子，都是连续镜头。女主从天台跳下，上一个镜头是迈出一只脚，下一个镜头整个人已经飞出去了，下面这里男主出门也是，上一个镜头刚打开门迈脚，下一个镜头已经出门回头关门了。\n两处都剪掉了主要的中间运动，这可不是乱剪的，很明显前一个镜头已经给足了信息量，已经通过场景和肢体特写提示你角色要做什么了（比较巧合两处的第一个镜头都是脚的特写），所以下一个镜头直接给角色完成这个动作的状态，过渡是很自然的。\n和我之前写过的本季另一部新番《异世界舅舅》的演出正好形成了有趣的对照。\n如何评价 7 月新番动画《异世界叔叔》第二集？\n异世界舅舅是在动作完成后去延长静止的状态，在静止中品味余韵和气氛，而《彻夜之歌》是剪掉动作，让镜头连接非常紧凑，节奏感很强，和作品这种pop的氛围融合也非常恰当。两种演出风格截然相反，但都利用了观众的预期和暗示这种底层逻辑，原理上是相通的，可以说是同一颗视觉原理的种子开出不同的花朵。\n\n再举一个第一话的例子，男主回忆里拒绝女二表白，第一个镜头是两人在教室里面对面的静止的大全景俯拍，第二个镜头接女主跑出画面，动作上第二个镜头开始时女主已经转身一半了，而且和上一个镜头的静止不同，速度很快，这里也是用到了剪掉中间动作的手法。同时前后连接的两个镜头在构图、角度、焦距、光源、前后景的配置等等元素上都明显不同，表现出非常紧凑的拼接感。\n这就是一种SHAFT演出家常用的镜头连接方法。オトナアニメ的特集《SHAFT超全集！！》（2010年出版）里就进行过分析，材料是用的当年最火的《化物语》：\n\n\n该书对SHAFT式剪辑的概括：\n动作的省略\n不让演技连上\n同一场景也让画改变\n降低颜色的彩度（《彻夜之歌》是反过来调高彩度）\n以及对这种演出效果的评论：\n仔细注意的话就会发现，几乎没有一个动作跨越两个镜头。每一个镜头都具有高度的独立性和充实度。\n从个性强烈的镜头之间的碰撞中诞生的违和感，以之为武器的演出充满挑战性。\n可以看出，在本季诸多SHAFT相关的作品之中，板村智幸最显眼地继承了这种特色的演出，也难怪会看到“SHAFT在SHAFT模仿大赛中获得第二名”的玩笑了。\n\n来源：知乎

号，中国原创作品已占60%\n\n因为问题问的是《画书大王》中的国漫作品，因此《画王》中的日漫作品诸如《静斗士·翔》、《城市猎人》、《七龙珠》等这里就不再一一赘述，还有许多优秀的外国作品，诸如美国的《花生漫画》、新加坡的《我的暑假》等，这里也不再多提。\n感兴趣的朋友可以到阿卡俱乐部[2]直接欣赏所有作品。\n首先，画书大王一共24期，一共出现原创中国漫画34部作品，短篇20篇、中篇连载9部。长篇连载5部，另外还有画王征稿一共58篇超短篇。\n经过我反复阅读，总结图如下\n中长短篇连载作品盘点\n\n94画王超短篇征稿选登\n\n我们按照作品最初连载时间来一一回顾一下这些优秀的中国漫画\n\n王庸生/谭晓春  《蟠桃会》\n\n ■《蟠桃会》王庸声编剧、谭晓春等绘画\n作为一位由传统连环画转入新漫画探索的漫画家,谭晓春在创作中“既要认真学习外国画法的长处,又要不断克服过去长期作画形成的习惯”,做到这点实属不易。\n在这个由“连环画”到“新漫画”的探索时期，借用西游记的国民度来继续创作后续故事和如今的“蹭西游IP”其实有很大程度类似，但在当时由于是开创者，因此也属于摸着石头过河，事实证明，这种做法是相当可取\n\n而整个故事跳脱于西游记后传，以二郎神和牛魔王的儿子为主角，带我们领略了更多的上古时期神明的风采（诸如炎帝，祝融等）\n\n\n陈军《天剑》\n\n  ■陈军大师的这部长篇奇幻冒险故事作品，分为人间篇、地狱篇、天堂篇、梦幻篇\n然而可惜的是画王上只刊登了10集，也是唯一的10集，光是这短短10集就看的出来整部这部作品的独特的构思，超前的想象力，甚至能看到现在所谓玄幻的概念，要知道那才1993年。\n\n真正令人震惊的是后来才知道《天剑》居然只是人间篇的一个章节的名称，也就是说整个作品都还没有正式的命名，那么可想而知这部作品的整个故事架构有多宏大。\n用今天的眼光来看这部作品会稍显稚嫩，但是在当时可谓是为无数少年少女开启了科幻漫画的启蒙！\n而陈军老师也在09年不幸因病去世，给读者留下永远的遗憾\n\n\n王培堃《中国古代谋略家》\n\n在画王初期，没有太多的国内原创作品，而王老先生的《中国古代谋略大师系列》就起到了一个至关重要的作用\n\n从第9期开始连载《姜子牙》到22期《伍子胥》结束，王老先生在画王上连载这个系列一共15期，除了上面提到的两位大师，还有我们熟知的管仲，晏婴，和不太熟知的田穰苴\n\n\n\n王老先生的系列作品，在让我们了解这几位谋略大师的丰功伟绩之外，还带领读者了解那个时期，那个时代的风土人情，像极了一位用自己经历教授我们知识的历史老师\n\n而老先生在24期连载的作品《金梭 银梭》由于杂志停刊，只有上篇没有下篇，实属可惜\n\n陈吟、徐赐林《大鹏出世》\n ■这部《大鹏出世》选自《精忠报国》，主要讲述的是岳飞为报效国家所经历的种种磨难，以及他如何化险为夷成为大英雄的故事。\n\n该作品是一部香港式画法的连环画，是《画书大王》中其中一部由连环画向新型漫画探索的作品之一。\n\n我们可以看到大鹏和建筑的画面，是那么地栩栩如生，彰显了作者的绘画功底\n\n\n而故事中岳飞的形象阳光而正气，非常符合国人心中大英雄的形象，分镜也能看出还有部分连环画的影子，对话框也采用最基础的长方框，不过这在当时来说，已经是非常大的进步\n\n由于作品是半月刊，加之历史改编类漫画工程繁冗，因此作品在连载6话以后（第8期），完成了一小节的剧情推进以后就没了下文。\n\n\n田恒玉《故事新画》\n田恒玉老师擅长用现代语言和新的漫画手法继续创作古代故事，同时也搞些“戏说”之类的娱乐性小品。\n\n田老师的故事新画系列也是画书大王中连载期数最多的作品，高达12期！每一个故事都蕴含着一个小道理，真正做到了寓教于乐。\n\n田恒玉的圆很注意人物造型,，其是面部表情，夸张而不失真，把人的七情六欲，精巧呆傻，描绘得淋满尽致，使漫画的表现功能得以充分发挥，他说“连环漫画的关键是趣味，有趣味就勾人腮帮子，吸引读者非看不可，这种趣味不应是硬抠人家的胳肢窝,应当是自然的，现实的，夸张适度的，顺理成章的，合乎逻辑的。\n\n在谈到创作体验时，他说:“漫画作者应具有幽默细胞，研究人们笑的“神经”和“穴位”，骨子里缺乏幽默感，成天一本正经,面冷似冰的人不宜搞漫画,”他从四格漫画开始,逐渐发展到中篇故事，不论什么，都是严谨地遵循自己的创作原则。\n\n\n陈翔《小山日记》\n\n《小山日记》可谓陈翔前期代表作之一，虽然带有明显的模仿鸟山明的痕迹，但也有自己的创新，人物造型夸张又不失可爱，故事幽默风趣，想象力天马行空。\n更重要的是，《小山日记》已经看不到连环画风格的影子，在当时的原创漫画作品里可谓鹤立鸡群。\n\n所以才短短连载几期，《小山日记》便已成为画王的头牌作品。从第10期开始连载，到24期结束，除了23期因故没有如期连载，《小山日记》总共在画王上连载了14话。\n很多读者都在给编辑部的信中表示：“没想到我国的作者也能创作出这么好的漫画！”\n\n随着《画王》的停刊，陈翔的《小山日记》转战《卡通王》和《超速风暴》，不过由于杂志本身问题，导致《小山日记》也不了了之，如今如果还想重温这部作品，估计只能收集仅有的3本单行本了。\n\n\n颜开《雪椰》\n《雪椰》，1996年出版、被视作“中国第一本漫画单行本”，现在已加入“珍藏级别”。\n漫画讲述高中生男主在忽然收到一个包裹，包裹里竟是一名来自未来世界的女孩雪椰。原来，自然环境在2398年因核污染而濒临崩坏。为了保护最后的家园，雪椰受嘱托回到过去、寻找帮助。\n万万没想到，时空机出现故障，雪椰被带到一个陌生的时空。男主了解情况后，决定保护雪椰，并展开一段对抗恶势力的冒险故事。\n\n《雪椰》的大主题虽是打斗与冒险，但情感描绘得很细腻，钢铁与柔情的篇幅各占一半，令它同时斩获男性、女性读者的心，同时与传统少年漫画区分开来，形成独属颜开的风格。\n《雪椰》火到什么程度？截至2000年，共推出8册单行本、总销量高达50万册；漫画虽在2000年停载，但直到2005年都一直端坐在国漫销量冠军的宝座上。\n\n与陈翔一样，颜开老师最初的风格有明显的模仿北条司的画风，但是在后期逐渐探索出自己的故事走向，形成自己的独特风格。\n94年《画王》连载了8话停刊之后，《雪椰》开始了辗转的换刊连载生涯。先是《三优新漫画》，再是《科普画王》，《科幻世界画刊》……有时候，是没连载几期，杂志就又停刊了，至今依旧是中国读者心中的痛。\n\n关于《雪椰》这部作品， @颜开大叔 已经在知乎上亲自答过了，感兴趣的朋友可以看看\nhttps://www.zhihu.com/question/320068340/answer/1255136684\n长虹《剑气长江》 \n\n 这应该是国内漫画史上第一部正宗武侠小说改编的新型漫画作品，出自温瑞安的同名小说。笔法简练豪放，绘制娴熟自然，分镜处理和氛围渲染非常到位，整部作品就如名称一般一看就有种令人荡气回肠的豪侠气势。  \n\n 遗憾的是本作只刊登了4期就完结了（17-20期），或许有小说版权的原因。也或者说是当时市场上还未能接受这种形式的改编，不过也为今后同类作品开了个好头。\n\n\n胡倩蓉《辛德蕾拉》\n胡倩蓉的《新年的礼物》是94画王超短篇第一篇刊登的作品（15期）\n在4个月后的第19期，刊登了其处女作《辛德蕾拉》\n《辛德蕾拉》是一个只有3话的短篇，但是我们可以窥见胡倩蓉在当时高二的年龄展示出的潜能\n简洁的线条，略微稚嫩的分镜，追求美型的人设，那双追求美妙爱情的女主的眼睛，仿佛胡倩蓉追求漫画真谛的渴望双眼\n故事非常玛丽苏，非常典型的少女漫走向，但在当时取得了非常好的反响，也因此坚定了胡倩蓉日后继续创作的心。\n\n\n\n\n\n郑旭升《我们的鸦片战争》\n1994年，郑旭升在国内第一本漫画杂志《画王》评选漫画形象代言活动中取得冠军，同年在《画王》上连载自己的第一部长篇漫画作品《我们的鸦片战争》。\n他的作品《师生情》以及寓教寓乐的《我们的鸦片战争》，让许多的读者认识了他。\n在后来金虹出版的《漫画原子弹》里，他又相继以《男生宿舍古怪事》《无名星域风暴》等作品奠定了半写实的画风。也为后来的《繁华如梦》《幽灵列车》等作品的成功打下了基础。\n\n《我们的鸦片战争》的创作背景是当时的禁烟潮流，当时的香烟被人们称为新的鸦片\n故事以一家老小都爱抽烟的烟民作为开端，通过一系列生活小故事告诫读者抽烟的危害，还科普了非常多有关禁烟的知识点，奈何由于画王的停刊，这部作品只连载了短短的三期，随后不断辗转《新漫画》《漫画原子弹》等杂志，但是依旧没有完整地连载结束。随着禁烟的浪潮过去，这部作品也失去社会意义，因此郑旭升也没有继续连载下去了。\n\n\n阿恒《少林正宗》\n\n初看《少林传奇》以为是日后那种港漫风格的作品，没想到竟然是少林文化的未来机甲科幻风故事，很是新奇。并且已经具备日后港漫那种线条感以及夸张的战斗动作的风格。\n同样可惜的是，本作只在《画书大王》连载了2期，《画书大王》停刊后接着在《科幻世界画刊》上连载，而后在《漫画原子弹》上续载，最后集结成单行本出版。\n而阿恒和洪虹后来转移到深圳重新注册成立金虹公司，推出《漫画原子弹》，以及将港漫发扬光大的故事，都是后话了。\n\n\n\n\n\n94画王超短篇征稿选登\n《画书大王》在第10期之时做出一个意义深远的决定——举办“94画王杯超短篇有奖征稿活动”。\n\n所谓超短篇，是指只有四页纸的漫画作品。由于页数很少，对作画者的要求不高，即使没画过漫画的人也可以一试身手。\n征稿启事一出，国内漫画爱好者们的热情便被完全激发出来了，雪片般的来稿从全国各地飞往《画书大王》的编辑部。\n所以从第15期《画书大王》开始，首批来稿与读者见面，我们从下图中可以看到许多如今依旧响当当的名号，胡倩荣、郑旭升、赵佳、蒋翎（自由鸟）\n\n从第15期到21期，一共刊登了58部作品，年龄段从最小的12岁到青年不等，其中初高中生的投稿比例占据60%\n\n这些短篇作品中质量参差不齐，但是类型确实是百花齐放，其中以年仅12岁的“鬼女”赵佳的《画王讨论会》独树一帜\n作品以辩论会的形式来讨论画漫画的特技问题，有趣的是在辩论双方阐述自己观点的同时，还将这种漫画达到的效果展示出来，真正做到了寓教于乐。\n非常难能可贵的是，辩论双方的人物都是在画王中连载作品的人物形象，年仅12岁的赵佳就应经能模仿中日画风达到以假乱真的境界，难怪日后能创作出《黑血》这种经典作品。\n\n读者评价：画王讨论会非常新颖有趣！重点！12岁少女！！\n\n郑旭升\n三剑客之一的郑旭升的处女作，讲述一个名字叫皮蛋的少年，连续被留了五年的一年级，原因竟然是班主任女老师长得特别想自己去世的妈妈，然后这位老师最后嫁给了男主的爸爸\n真不愧是郑旭升的脑洞哈哈哈，看似荒谬的背后蕴含着一丝合理，表达了当时社会环境下对再婚家庭的一种看法。\n\n除了这些以外，还有各种风格的短篇，让每位当时热爱漫画的新人崭露头角\n有武侠风格的《风云录》、日常搞笑风格的《金钱梦的破灭》\n\n还有着最代表当时从连环画转向新型漫画风格的，具有儿童故事情节的《夺回鸟蛋》\n\n还有充满甜甜爱情，漫画中绝对不可或缺的少女漫\n\n当然还有最多读者喜爱的冒险漫画风格、科幻风格以及模仿借鉴日漫的作品\n\n大部分作品都能做到完整表达一个故事，也存在着诸如分镜混乱，线条饱满，网点滥用等一系列问题，但是这群年轻人让我们看到了，也让当时的中国漫画界看到了中国漫画未来的希望。\n\n最后，让我们再次记住这群曾为了中国漫画做出贡献的年轻人们。\n\n关于画书大王，能说的非常多，我看知乎上介绍的都已经很全面了，最后我借这个回答，稍微补充几点自己总结的，供大家参考，为啥画书大王会被如今这么多漫画家、甚至漫画爱好者推崇！\n\n\n画王之所以是那么多人心中的漫画启蒙[3]。结合资深国漫博主jjf2011的文章[4]以及个人见解，综合认为有以下几点原因：\n1.第一期试刊的最后一页刊登了“画王形象”有奖征集的告示与评选揭晓\n\n在《画书大王》的第一期试刊的最后一页刊登了“画王形象”有奖征集的告示，引发全国漫画爱好者的创作与投稿\n“画王形象”的评选结果也于22期揭晓，由郑旭升设计的角色最终获得了票选冠军，从而成为了杂志的形象代言人。\n另外从本期开始分别在杂志的封面和封底开始连载法国漫画家唐.劳伦斯的全彩漫画《英雄风暴》的节选。另外“画王形象”也于第23期开始正式登陆杂志封面！\n\n\n2.除了日漫和国漫外刊登了一些亚洲和欧美漫画家的作品。\n包括不仅限于\n新加坡的阿米巴的《我的暑假》\n美国的舒尔茨的《花生漫画》\n法国的唐·劳伦斯的《英雄暴风》\n西班牙的维·塞格里斯《白甲卫士》\n在那个以日本漫画为主流的时代，这也给了国人一次很好解其他风格漫画的机会，大大开阔了读者的眼界。可能是读者年龄层次的不同，当年《画书大王》的开放性和包容性绝对是如今大部分的主流漫画杂志难以企及的。\n\n\n3.在《画书大王》第八期的最末端刊登了“1994年画王超级短篇有奖征稿”启事\n这是中国漫画史上第一次的正规批量征稿！可以说这是对于整个中国漫画发展影响极其深远的事件之一。中国漫画从此有了一个可以真正展示自身才华的舞台，这个消息犹如深水炸弹般迅速的在广大画谜中间炸开，一石激起千层浪大批狂热的漫画爱好者们从而拿起了画笔，由纯粹的漫画读者转为了漫画参与者。\n4.超短篇征稿入选作品纷纷刊登！\n此时杂志单期的发行量已经突破了50万大关，就在此时“94年超短篇”有奖征稿活动的入选作品也从第15期开始陆续刊登！并在广大画谜中引发不小的轰动，以此为契机编辑部也决定成立自己的专业漫画工作室！并开始物色工作室成员。在这些超短篇大赛入围作品中有很多我们大家日后非常的熟悉名字，其中包括了：赵佳、林敏、蒋翎、胡倩蓉、柴美华以及潘广维等多位漫画界的明日之星\n“1994年画王超短篇”选登活动正式结束，从杂志的第15期-第21期共计刊登入选作品58篇，这也是中国漫画史上第一次大规模选用和刊登新人作品的活动，这种模式直接被后来“5155时期”的各家漫画杂志广泛的效仿和应用。\n\n\n5.“三剑客漫画工作室”正式成立！\n在杂志第17期推出之前，位于北京的《画书大王》漫画工作室正式成立了，首批入驻的三位青年漫画作者分别是：陈翔、郑旭升和颜开！他们共同为工作室起了一个响亮的名字“三剑客漫画工作室”！中国历史上第一个职业漫画工作室就此成立，这是对于整个中国漫画发展影响极其深远的事件之一！漫画工作室的出现不仅整合了资源还极大的提高了效率，尝到甜头的编辑部开始着手准备第二个工作室的创建，当时准备邀请：胡蓉、姚非拉、柴美华以及聂峻等一批优秀的漫画工作者加入，但由于杂志的突然停刊这个计划最终流产......\n\n\n6.画王刊登鸟山明的《漫画研究所》及《漫画学校》\n从画王第一期开始，就刊登了日本漫画大师鸟山明用漫画形式讲解如何创作漫画的作品\n鸟山明大师用通俗易懂的表达告诉国内读者，究竟怎样才能成为漫画家，这也是画王被称为国内第一批漫画家启蒙的原因之一\n\n漫画研究所总共连载十三期，从如何创作人物到用什么铅笔，什么墨水，到怎么画分镜，绘图远近法最后还教你怎么投稿等等，为国内有意向的读者打开一扇大门！\n\n而在漫画研究所完结以后，刊登了更高阶的同样出自鸟山明之手的《漫画学校》\n\n\n\n\n7.画王信箱与画友论坛开设\n\n作为画王杂志直接与读者对话的栏目，我们可以了解到当时非常多的一些社会现象，比如当时的漫画还是连环画，家长们普遍不接受漫画的观念等等\n\n同时，也是让许多读者发出自己声音的一个栏目，让我们看到当时有那么多读者用自己的行动，自己的声音告诉中国的漫画家，加油！\n\n8.优秀中外漫画家以及世界漫画史介绍\n画王从试看刊之初，就已经开设『人物介绍』一栏，在让国内读者欣赏名家之作的同时，向大家阐述那些创作出这些优秀作品的漫画家们，其中包括\n台湾郑问，车田正美，鸟山明，高桥阳一\n\n黄玉郎，手冢治虫，藤子不二雄，高桥留美子，马荣成\n\n谭晓春，北条司，成田美名子，安达充，田恒玉，叶精作，石田章太郎，王培堃，原哲夫，荒木飞吕彦\n\n以及比较冷门的细川知荣子，安彦良和柴门文，池田理代子，松本零士。\n再介绍作者的同时，杂志也在告诉中国读者世界漫画的发展，因此有了『世界漫画史话』的出现\n向读者展示了美国漫画，英国漫画的发展与演变，为中国读者了解世界漫画提供了一个很好的窗口。\n\n\n\n在jjf2011看来，《画书大王》的出现不仅填补国内没有专业漫画杂志的空白，它还书写了中国漫画史上的好多个第一！虽然它最终没能够结出果实，但它却开出了最为绚丽的花朵，同时也为整个中国原创漫画打开了一扇大门！正因为有了《画书大王》当年不惜余力的对中国原创漫画全方位的探索，日后才会有了国内漫画杂志“百花齐放”的场景出现。\n《画书大王》作为中国漫画发展史上一个无法逾越的里程碑，它永远屹立于一代读者的心中！\n\n

Nyota Uhura in the original Star Trek series, died on Saturday due to heart failure. Fans, friends, colleagues, and admirers are all paying tribute to the groundbreaking performer, who inspired countless people through both her acting and her advocacy. She was 89.\nThough Nichols sang and performed in musicals in the early '60s, it was her portrayal of the USS Enterprise's communications officer Uhura that ultimately brought her to fame. Uhura was celebrated as among the first Black characters on American television not in a menial role, and in fact was a respected, equal member of Star Trek's ensemble cast. \nAs such, Nichols became a powerful figure of positive Black representation, inspiring people such as NASA astronaut Mae Jemison and actor Whoopi Goldberg — as well as becoming the celebrity crush of then-future president Barack Obama.\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\nFamously, Nichols didn't realise the impact she already had early in Star Trek's run, and considered leaving for a role on Broadway when the series was still in its first season. Fortunately, she was dissuaded upon meeting civil rights activist Dr. Martin Luther King at a fundraiser, who approached her as an enthusiastic fan and stressed how important her work was in breaking boundaries. After learning that she intended to leave the show, he personally convinced her to stay.\n\"We talked a long time about what it all meant and what images on television tell us about ourselves,\" Nichols told The Wall Street Journal in 2011. \"It's one of the most important things that happened in my life and it changed and defined my career. I took my role much more seriously after that.\"\nNichols ultimately stayed on Star Trek and continued to inspire viewers for all three seasons. This included the famous kiss between Captain Kirk and Uhura during Season 3, which aired just one year after interracial marriage was made legal in the U.S., and is now considered a significant step regarding interracial relationships being represented on American television.\n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            7 women in science who will inspire you to get serious about STEM\n                            \n                    \n    \nNichols continued to look to the stars even after Star Trek's run ended, volunteering with a NASA Astronaut Corps project to hire marginalised employees. This project resulted in the recruitment of America's first female astronaut, Dr. Sally Ride, as well as its first Black astronaut, Colonel Guion Bluford.\nShe further served on the board for the then-called National Space Institute, a non-profit space advocacy group, and was involved in leadership of the Space Cadets of America. For her work, Nichols was awarded NASA's Distinguished Public Service Medal — the agency's highest form of recognition for a non-government employee.\nNASA is among those paying tribute to Nichols today, remembering her as an inspirational role model and symbol of a brighter future.\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\nRest in peace, lieutenant.","provider":"Mashable"},{"title":"'Wordle' today: Here's the answer, hints for August 1","link":"https://mashable.com/article/wordle-today-answer-august-1","date":"2022-08-01 03:00:41","content":"New month, new week, new day, new Wordle! Mondays can be tough, but your favorite word game doesn't have to be. We're here to help with some subtle clues that will make you remember that you do, in fact, know some words.\nThe answer to the August 1 Wordle, puzzle #408, can be found at the end of this article, or you can simply read on for a few tips, gentle hints, and strategies to help you every day.\nWhere did Wordle come from? \nFormer Reddit engineer Josh Wardle came up with the game in 2021 as a private exercise for him and his word game-loving partner. It eventually became a staple of their family WhatsApp messaging, and that's when Wardle started to suspect he might have something special enough to merit a wider release.\nThousands of people around the globe now play this game each day, and fans have even created alternatives to Wordle inspired by the original format.

You'll find the Wordle answer for July 31 here.\nWhat's the best Wordle starting word?\nWe have some ideas to help you pick the perfect first move. Such tips include choosing a word with at least two different vowels to rule those building blocks in or out, plus a few common consonants such as S, T, R, or N. \nAlso, even if you're attached to your mathematically sound starter, once it's been the answer on any given day it won't be the answer again for a few years — so if you happen to get the elusive 1/6 result, celebrate by swapping out your starting five.\nWhat happened to the Wordle archive?\nWhile you could once play the entire archive of past puzzles, the archive was taken down at the request of the New York Times, according to the site's creator.\nIs Wordle getting harder?\nIf you've been finding Wordle too easy, there is a Hard Mode you can enable to give yourself more of a challenge.

However, occasionally the puzzle game will accept two different correct solutions on the same day. This aberration is due to changes the New York Times began making after it acquired Wordle earlier this year, excising words form Wardle's original list that the team considers obscure or potentially offensive. \nTo make sure you're always getting the same puzzle as everyone else, refresh your browser before you play — don't worry, the site will keep your streak.\n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            Wordle-obsessed?

The arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic that closed schools and caused kids to be home at all times forced the topic into the spotlight even further. Youngsters spent more time online than ever before, due in part to the switch to virtual school and their parents' need to get work done while WFH.\nIt's natural for parents to freak out every time a new study about children and devices comes out, but here's our advice: Don't. The evidence between screen time and cognitive or behavior development isn't super strong. Plus, parents cannot blame themselves for handing a kid a tablet when it's time for a Zoom meeting, dinner prep, or a nap, especially when it's high-quality content like an educational show or interactive learning game.\nThat said, it would be naive to assume that kids are always soaking in high-quality content when they're on the internet. Though modern kids are scarily adept with technology and social media (TikTok is basically run by teenagers), it doesn't mean that parameters for web use aren't necessary. Keeping kids safe by monitoring their online activity (and setting reasonable limits) is just another task modern parents have to juggle. \nMinecraft may be distracting them from their school work, or maybe you'd just feel more comfortable about this increase in screen time if you knew that your child wasn't landing on any inappropriate sites or scrolling through Instagram at 3 a.m. Maybe you want them to engage more in family time together, sans screens. Whatever your reason, parental control software offers a solution to managing your child’s screen time.\nHow does parental control software work?\nThe short answer is that parental control software lets you monitor your child's device — phone, tablet, or computer — remotely. The corresponding apps let parents monitor internet searches and browsing history, block inappropriate apps (or block distracting apps during homework hours), or limit screen time altogether. It's a less invasive and more respectful method than physically going through their phone or computer — and when kids know that their activity is being watched or managed, cyber safety habits might stick better. While much parental control software requires a monthly or annual fee, there is some free parental control software available.\nIs geofencing worthwhile?\nParental control software can also help keep tabs on your kid when they're not at home. Though most have GPS and some sort of basic \"Where's my child?\" function, only a select few software options offer geofencing, which is a big help for parents juggling the schedules of multiple children. This location-based service lets you set up virtual boundaries around where a child should or shouldn't be, as well as a specific time that the child should (or shouldn't) be there. Let's say that your child goes straight from school to a sports practice three times a week. The geofencing feature will monitor their phone's location and will alert you if your child doesn't show up to the scheduled area on time. Teenagers may even enjoy the functionality of geofencing as it means not being bombarded with \"Where are you?\" texts.\nGeofencing can also be used to monitor web time when your child is in a designated location. For instance, many parents like to disable games or social media apps during school.\nWhat is the best parental control software?\nEvery parental control software (even free parental control apps) can put limits on screen time, show browsing history, and block sites. Got it. But some features might apply more to your family's needs than others.\nHouseholds with a lot of devices in the mix will need to look at device limits. Some software allows unlimited accounts while others work like cell phone plans: More devices, more money. If you have three or four kids who all have a phone and a laptop, the unlimited route will be the best value. Families that share a device will need to ensure that their software doesn't have a \"one account per device\" rule, which pretty much locks parents into dealing with kid settings (or vice versa, but that kind of defeats the purpose of the software in the first place).\nSome software gives kids more autonomy than others. If you're worried about smothering them, consider an option that provides warnings about screen time instead of immediately locking the device, or an option that lets them request extra time or access to a site that they feel is wrongfully blocked. Things may go smoother when older kids feel like they can have a say in the limits being set.\nWhat should I consider before choosing parental control software?\nThere are a few different things to keep in mind when searching for the best parental control software for your family’s needs. First, consider the age of your child(ren). Younger kiddos will need more stringent parent control features than tweens and teens. You may also want to block out more devices for the younger set than you would for older kids. \nAs mentioned above, you’ll also want to do the math as to how many devices should be included in any parental control subscription. If you have too few devices included then you may not be fully keeping tabs on all of the screens your kiddo may have access to. Too many devices on your subscription and you may be paying for more coverage and control than you need. \nYou’ll also want to consider whether or not you need any parental controls to work at home or while they’re out and about. If your kids can get around any limits you set by simply leaving home, then the software isn’t ideal. However, if you have older kids and don’t worry about what they access while at school (maybe their phone doesn’t have data?) then you might not need features that work outside your family’s WiFi network. \nFinally, consider using any built-in parental control options your device might already have. For example, use the passcode or password feature on cell phones, tablets, and laptops, to ensure little ones aren’t logging on without your knowledge. There are also several free browser plugins that will block specific websites with inappropriate content. On iOS devices, you can set screen time limits, block certain apps and websites, or restrict new downloads or things with an explicit content rating altogether. Your modem or router may also offer the ability for you to access parental controls that set limits on when specific devices can access WiFi. \nWith the above information in mind, here are our top choices for the best parental control apps and software for 2022:","provider":"Mashable"},{"title":"Taylor Swift can't stop emitting CO2 with her private plane.

That's 22,923 minutes, almost 16 total days, of airtime. The CO2 released into the atmosphere courtesy of Taylor Swift's private plane during these past 7 months is the equivalent to what 1,184 average people would emit in a year. The data came from the Twitter account, @CelebJets, which tracks celebrities' jets.\nIn response to this information, which is now going viral online, Swift's representatives say Swift isn't responsible for all the flights.\n​​\"Taylor's jet is loaned out regularly to other individuals,\" said the pop star's spokesperson in a statement. \"To attribute most or all of these trips to her is blatantly incorrect.\"\nStill, it is Taylor Swift's private plane! The fact that the list wasn't topped by someone like Kylie Jenner with her 12-minute flights or her sister Kim Kardashian seems to have surprised social media users a bit. But, the internet still delivered with some jokes. (And to be fair, it seems like it's all just a variation of the same joke over and over again. But, damn, they're all still pretty funny.)\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\nEve 6, the alternative rock band most well-known for their 90s hits \"Inside Out\" and \"Here's to the Night,\" got a little creative and decided to crack a joke about the statement from Swift's team.\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\nAnd one Taylor Swift fan decided to make a compilation of times that the artist mentions flying, airplanes, or any sort of travel in the lyrics of her songs.\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\nSome Swift stans are even jokingly playing damage control for Swift by posting photoshopped messages claiming the singer is donating to their (fake) environmental charity.

It did not go well.","link":"https://mashable.com/article/dr-disrespect-game-footage-deadrop-nft","date":"2022-07-31 19:27:25","content":"Popular video-game streamer Dr Disrespect on Sunday revealed early footage from the first game of his new gaming studio, a first-person shooter titled Deadrop. People are already tearing it to shreds on social media. \nThe announcement comes months after Dr Disrespect announced the launch of the games studio he founded with Call of Duty and Halo veterans Robert Bowling, Quinn DelHoyo, and Sumit Gupta called Midnight Society. Disrespect founded the studio a year after he was permanently banned on Twitch for still unknown reasons and is now on a quest to create video games that rival the best FPS franchises.\nDisrespect and Midnight Studios describe the game as \"the world's first vertical extraction shooter\" and early access has been given to fans who bought the $50 Founders Access Passes. And to be clear — more clear than the definition of a \"vertical extraction shooter\" — this is early footage and you can tell in the video below by the choppy framerate, poor gun mechanics, lack of animations, sound design, etc. \n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\nHowever, what makes the reveal sting even worse was Disrespect's comments on the game in June. He stated in a now-deleted tweet that Deadrop \"blows out anything from CoD engine.\" Subsequently, his bold claim was met with ridicule by fans. Some have compared it to a mobile game and others have described it as an arcade shooter you'd find at Chuck E.

Players who have bought the Founder Pass have access to snapshot builds of the game that release every six weeks. These snapshots come with \"procedurally generated NFTs of a character who serves as [the player's] in-game avatar.\" \nAgain, this game is in the very early stages of development, and it's very uncommon to show gameplay this early in the process for the obvious reasons seen above. A release date is far in the future for Deadrop so maybe Dr Disrespect will prove us wrong and the game will blow away our expectations. Maybe.","provider":"Mashable"},{"title":"A TikTok Music app could challenge Spotify and Apple","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/31/23286166/tiktok-music-app-challenge-spotify-apple-streaming-bytedance","date":"2022-07-31 19:01:14","content":"Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nConsidering how intertwined music discovery is with TikTok, it wouldn’t be all that surprising if the company launched a music streaming app of its own.

It's unclear exactly what the Tesla CEO was trying to get at. However, based on Musk's previous vocal opinions about \"free speech,\" bans, and censorship on social media platforms, it's clear how his followers were taking it.\nSomething nefarious is afoot. \nMany Musk faithful assume Twitter, the company that Elon Musk apparently pretended to want to buy and is now suing the billionaire over backing out of the signed deal to acquire it, is to blame for their tweets not receiving more interactions.\nIs Twitter shadowbanning specific, ostensibly pro-Musk, users? Shadowbans are basically when a social media platform demotes accounts or specific content in its algorithm so they reach fewer users. Others questioned if Twitter was hard at work removing all the fake accounts and bots thanks to Musk's complaint (and his excuse as to why he wants to back out of his legally binding $44 billion contract with Twitter.)\nHere's the truth. The reason you may be seeing less engagement on Twitter in July 2022 is because the Earth is conspiring with the Sun and its affecting the weather.\nThis is called Summer. \nThe Northern Hemisphere of the Earth experiences this phenomenon during the months of June, through September. Days begin earlier and nightfall comes later. July, smackdab in the middle of that period, is often the hottest month of the year. Many people go outside to enjoy the warm weather and take part in outdoor events. Music festivals, barbecues, beach trips, and visits to the theme park are popular summer activities. People step away from long days working on their computers at their office desks, log off, and go on vacation.\n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            Elon Musk, the hype man who rarely delivers.\n                            \n                    \n    \n\"In past years, entire industries saw summer slumps -- or seasonal dips in sales or web traffic,\" wrote Pamela Bump, manager of content growth at HubSpot, in a 2021 report on this phenomenon. \nThe report, published in July 2021 and updated the following September with additional data, compared last year's summer internet slump with the summer slumps from previous years. The only industry that didn't experience a web traffic downturn was leisure and hospitality because, obviously, people were using the online businesses in that field to plan trips and getaways. Post-COVID, that summer internet traffic slump appears to increase as individuals look to get out of their houses and make up for those lost summer getaways during the heights of the pandemic.\nThis isn't a new trend, and it's not relegated to just Twitter, either. A 2013 study by the social media analytics firm Fanpage Karma found that interactions on Facebook posts increased by 42 percent on average when there was bad weather compared to when there was good weather. A rainy day on a summer weekend could increase Facebook post interactions by as much as 90 percent.\nThere has been data showing that mobile web use – people surfing the web via their smartphones – has increased during the summer in recent years. But, people are most likely logging into their social media profiles to talk about their summer activities, not Elon Musk's latest tweet complaining about the lack of sex he's been having.\n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\n​​\"We’re seeing a 220% increase in conversations about music festivals during the summer,\" says Twitter, in a Twitter Insights blog post from the company's marketing department. Twitter finds that the type of conversations currently trending on the platform involves \"summer anticipation and prep.\" Many users are focused on the summer activities they're experiencing or are excited about.\nSo, historically, as a result of SUMMER, many websites, platforms, and online businesses see a decrease in traffic. But, if it helps with your engagement numbers, Elon, I guess we can all pretend you're being shadowbanned by the sun.","provider":"Mashable"},{"title":"The Pixel 6A is getting an immediate update to make sure it’s moddable","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/31/23286119/google-pixel-6a-update-moddable-unlocked-bootloader-rooting-custom-roms","date":"2022-07-31 16:38:46","content":"Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nJust days after the Pixel 6A’s launch, Google’s rolling out an update to fix an issue preventing users from unlocking the bootloader and performing mods, according to a report from Android Police.

It's a search engine.","link":"https://mashable.com/article/gen-z-tiktok-search-engine-google","date":"2022-07-31 11:00:00","content":"Zach Carter, a 24-year-old brand strategist from Los Angeles, curates his searches to which social platform he’s on. \"I'll go to TikTok for fashion, food, or culture because I know the user base of the app provides that content, whereas on Twitter I’ll search for the news.\" Carter isn't the only one: Increasingly, young people are using social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram to search for things to do and places to try, even seeking out news and important information, rather than consulting traditional discovery tools like Google Search and Google Maps.\nAccording to TechCrunch, Google’s Prabhakar Raghavan, a senior vice president in charge of Google Search, said, \"In our studies, something like almost 40 percent of young people, when they're looking for a place for lunch, they don't go to Google Maps or Search. They go to TikTok or Instagram.\" He's referring to a survey of U.S. users, ages 18 to 24. \nAs someone within that age group, the statistic doesn't surprise me. Growing up with access to the internet, I've learned to customize my experience on the internet. I know where to go for what, and when searching for something hyper-specific sometimes Google Search isn't always my best friend. But I was curious how other people within Google’s age range searched, so I spoke with 30 of my peers about their online search habits. \nA UK survey found that TikTok is the fastest growing source of news among young adults ages 16 to 24. This obviously raises alarm because of the rampant misinformation on the platform, but TikTok isn't only being used as a news source. \nAmanda Cash, a 22-year-old law school student, searches TikTok for recipe ideas and travel recommendations. Meanwhile, 24-year-old Teresa in Southern California seeks out instructional how-to videos that are \"shorter and more to the point\" then what she’d typically find on YouTube. \nI found that people are using TikTok similarly to how they use Pinterest. In February of this year TikTok launched a new feature called Collections, essentially copying Pinterest’s defining feature. Collections allows TikTok users to organize their favorited videos into folders. Instagram implemented a similar feature in 2019. The Collections feature allows users to save recommendations and organize them into useful categories, making it easier for users to quickly return to ideas and recommendations. \n\n    \nThe Pinterest-esque collection feature on TikTokkers allows users to organize their favorited videos.\n            Credit: Screenshot: TikTok\n        \n\"I'll search 'thrifting in Paris' or 'restaurants in Lisbon' and save the things that look good to a little folder to refer back to. I also have a little recipe folder. [I am a] big fan of the folder feature,\" explained Cash.\n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            How to organize your favorite TikToks into collections\n                            \n                    \n    \nIt's not just that people are searching for suggestions on TikTok. They're also relying on their individual algorithms to feed them geo-specific recommendations. If you find something you want to try, you can save it to a folder and return to your favorites when you need inspiration for where to go or what to cook. \nIn talking to my peers, three things came up in nearly every conversation about what people turn to social media for: recipes, restaurants, and travel recommendations.\nPeople are sick of the Google recipe algorithm that prioritizes obscure search engine optimized blogs. It's been a running joke on the internet that in order to read a recipe you have to get through the blogger’s entire life story, but this is actually deterring the young people I talked to from searching for recipes on Google. Because a TikTok has to quickly grab your attention, recipe videos on the platform are to the point, putting the focus on the food, not the creator. \nEmily Mariko, one of the most popular food creators on TikTok, doesn’t talk to her 11.5 million followers in her videos, rather she lets the food speak for itself. She draws the viewer in with her straightforward visual recipes and tidy plating, showing how enticing video recipes can be without someone telling you every single step. It's a huge draw for 23-year-old Kyra Papazian. \"I mainly use TikTok and Instagram to look up recipes as opposed to searching that on Google,\" she told Mashable. \"It can be a specific search like 'banana bread' or [a] general search like, 'dinner ideas.' It's so much easier than searching a recipe on Google and scrolling through a long article.\"\n\n                \nEmily Mariko's tiding plating allows the food to speak for itself.\n                                                                            Credit: TikTok / emilymariko\n                                            \nCredit: TikTok / emilymariko\n                                            \nNatalie Gomas, a 23-year-old student from Boston, uses TikTok for recipes and workout ideas. \"The way recipes are done on webpages annoys me a lot. You have to scroll through so much stuff to get to the actual recipes,\" she told Mashable. Similarly, the workouts she finds on the app \"aren't too complicated\" to try at home. \"The workouts on TikTok are workouts I'd actually want to do.\"\nIn a TikTok, you can immediately see what a restaurant looks like and see the person recommending it. It allows for maximum vibe reconnaissance. Additionally, if someone made a TikTok on it, and it came up on your FYP, chances are it’s something you'll actually enjoy and the information is up to date. Since the pandemic began it's hard to know what information on Google Search is current. Several times I've found a restaurant through Google Search only to later discover that it's since gone out of business.\nElla Boyce, a 23 year-old who has spent the past year traveling in South America and Europe, relies on TikTok and Instagram for travel recommendations. \"A lot of blogs aren't designed for phones, so it's hard to read, and there's no centralized fount to crowd source info; it's all random decentralized blogs from Google,” Boyce explained to Mashable. \"It's harder to tell someone's credibility from an article than from a video because you can see the person.\"\nSo the next time you’re looking for travel inspiration or a place to grab a slice of pizza, you might find what you’re searching for on TikTok.","provider":"Mashable"},{"title":"All I’ve Worn This Summer Are Technical Jorts","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/i-love-technical-jorts/","date":"2022-07-31 11:00:00","content":"Forget (almost) all other performance clothing and just get this versatile denim.","provider":"Wired"},{"title":"VR Still Stinks Because It Doesn’t Smell","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/vr-still-stinks-because-it-doesnt-smell/","date":"2022-07-31 11:00:00","content":"Scent is the realest sense.

How can you possibly choose what movie to watch next?\nFor those of you who have Peacock (and why wouldn’t you? Their TV offerings are stacked!), we’re here to help. We’ve combed through the Peacock catalog to bring you the funniest comedies, the most moving dramas, the most suspenseful thrillers, and the all-around best movies for your viewing pleasure. All you need to bring is the popcorn!\n1. Bridesmaids\n\n    \n\n            Credit: Suzanne Hanover/Universal/Kobal/Shutterstock \n        \nIf you haven’t seen Bridesmaids, written by Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, we’re so sorry that you’ve obviously been trapped in a siren’s cave for the last 11 years — because there is simply no other excuse. Bridesmaids was an era-defining film. In 2011, there were still prominent male comedians claiming women couldn’t be funny! Bridesmaids put an end to the debate.\nWiig stars as Annie, a wayward thirty-something who feels out of step with her best friend Lillian (a perfect Maya Rudolph) when she meets the other women in Lillian’s bridal party. What follows is both romantic comedy and buddy flick, stuffed to the brim with punchlines, physical gags, and a repulsive and unforgettable gross-out scene. The entire cast here is flawless: Rose Byrne is delightfully haughty. Jon Hamm is perfect as a hot idiot/ Chris O'Dowd is a swoon-worthy love interest, and Melissa McCarthy was nominated for a dang Oscar for her scene-stealing performance as another misfit bridesmaid. Please escape the siren’s cave and see this legendary comedy — for your own good!\nHow to Watch: Bridesmaids is streaming on Peacock.\n2. The Outfit\n\n    \n\n            Credit: Focus Features\n        \nThis cleverly twisted crime film was written and directed by Graham Moore, who won an Oscar for his adapted screenplay of The Imitation Game in 2015. The incomparable Mark Rylance stars as a soft-spoken British tailor, who makes beautiful, bespoke men’s suits in 1950s Chicago. Unfortunately, most of his clientele are ruthless mobsters. The majority of the movie takes place in the span of one shocking and breathless night when his gangster clients seek shelter in the shop after an unexpected shootout from a rival organization.\nThe Outfit is a sophisticated and constantly surprising thriller. As Rylance’s assistant, Zoey Deutch is as charming as always, and Johnny Flynn thrives while playing against type as a no-good '50s gangster. It’s an absolute gem of a film that will keep you guessing the whole way through.\nHow to Watch: The Outfit is streaming on Peacock.\n3. The Fast and Furious franchise\nUniversal is the proud owner of the Fast and Furious franchise, so in any given month on Peacock, you’ll be able to watch at least one of the nine movies in this ongoing saga of cars going fast and occasionally blowing up. The earlier entries focus more on illegal street racing, whereas the later films expand the action to include heists, spy rings, cyber terrorists, hidden nuclear arsenals, and more. Yet they all orbit a central theme: “There’s a problem, and only this motley crew of street racers can solve it.” Honestly, there’s not much more you need to know!\n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            What I learned from watching all the 'Fast and Furious' movies in a row\n                            \n                    \n    \nThese movies are high-action, low-substance in the best possible way. They’re fun, they’re truly ridiculous in a self-aware way, and last but not least, the car stunts are absolutely insane. Celebrities love being in Fast and Furious movies, from Vin Diesel and Idris Elba to Dame Helen Mirren, and people love watching them. It’s a no-brainer.\nHow to Watch: The Fast and the Furious is streaming on Peacock.\n4. Dayveon \n\n    \n\n            Credit: Mama Bear Studios/Kobal/Shutterstock\n        \nDevin Blackmon stars as Dayveon, a young kid in Arkansas struggling in the aftermath of his brother’s death. Unmoored and spending his days listlessly wandering the little town he lives in, he is increasingly drawn to the sense of belonging he finds in a local gang. Directed by Amman Abbasi, with a script by Abbasi and Steven Reneau, Dayveon is a sophisticated and deeply intimate film, made even more incredible by the fact that its cast is primarily made up of non-actors. It’s a moving and beautifully shot story that feels wholly, heartbreakingly real. \nHow to Watch: Dayveon is streaming on Peacock.\n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            13 Best shows on Peacock for when you need a break or a binge-watch\n                            \n                    \n    \n5. Looper\n\n    \n\n            Credit: Filmdistrict/Kobal/Shutterstock \n        \nThe best way to hide a body is to send it back in time, or so goes the prevailing logic of Looper, one of the best science-fiction movies of the last decade. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a Looper, an assassin in the year 2044. He kills the poor souls that his mob bosses send to him from 30 years in the future. Joe dutifully waits at a specific spot and time for his target to appear so he can do the dirty deed and collect the cash with no one the wiser. The system works perfectly until the day he comes face to face with his latest hit — his future self, played by a superb Bruce Willis. \nIt’s a fantastic time-travel movie that shines even brighter because of its cast of immensely relatable and grounded characters. Writer and director Rian Johnson’s futuristic world is fascinating, but how Joe grapples with it is even more so. Willis shines in an uncharacteristically antagonistic role, Gordon-Levitt matches Willis’ energy seamlessly, and Emily Blunt is a surprise second-act star. Looper is a breathless thriller, as exciting as it is thought-provoking.\nHow to Watch: Looper is streaming on Peacock.\n6. Trainwreck\n\n    \n\n            Credit: Moviestore/Shutterstock \n        \nThe mid-2010s brought us ombre hair, planking, and #YOLO, but its most enduring cultural addition was a wave of movies about imperfect women. More female-led films at the box office meant there was finally enough space for leading ladies who didn’t have to meet every standard to which we hold the modern women. Movie theaters were flooded with bad moms, anti-heroines, and the sloppiest drunks you’ve ever seen in your life. Enter Trainwreck, a hilarious and irreverent rom-com directed by Judd Apatow and starring Amy Schumer in a role that’s basically her hot mess stand-up persona come to life. \nIn this hysterical comedy, Schumer and Bill Hader are surprisingly charming together as opposites attract. Plus, John Cena and LeBron James both add an unexpected sparkle to a fun and cheeky romance.\nHow to Watch: Trainwreck is streaming on Peacock.\n7. Ip Man\n\n    \n\n            Credit: Dreams Salon Culture/Pegasus Motion/Kobal/Shutterstock\n        \nIp Man is an exciting Hong Kong martial arts biopic about the extraordinary life of the Wing Chun grandmaster who was Bruce Lee’s martial arts teacher. The film tracks Ip Man’s journey from the Southern Chinese village where he was well known as a skilled martial artist, to his family’s displacement during the Japanese occupation of the Second Sino-Japanese War, to his eventual rise as a fighter, and his establishment of a school in Hong Kong. \nStarring the skillful Donnie Yen, Ip Man doesn't skimp on character development; it's an electrifying rumination on philosophy, power, and honor in addition to its stunning action. Ip Man is a deeply influential film in the martial arts genre and, to everyone’s delight, has inspired three equally stirring sequels, all of which are available on Peacock. \nHow to Watch: Ip Man is streaming on Peacock.\n8. Harry Potter (The entire series!)\nAnd now the franchise that needs no introduction: Harry Potter. The original eight-movie series starts as a charming coming-of-age tale about a boy wizard learning about magic and ends as a serious and emotional allegory about fighting fascism and the lengths we will go to protect the people we love. Harry Potter is our hero, Ron Weasley our goofy best friend, and Hermione our actual hero, because duh.\nThough the quality of the movies vary based on the different directors at the helm and the age of the young leads, the strength of the source material paired with the prodigious gifts of the many, many storied British actors who fill out the sparkling supporting cast assure a satisfying watch. Most agree that the final two movies, each covering half of the last book in the series, are the most enthralling in the group — but you’ll have to watch them all to get what’s going on. So, you might as well start with number one, The Sorcerer’s Stone, and go from there. Poor you! You’re about to have a really great time!\nHow to Watch: Harry Potter is streaming on Peacock.\n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            'The Secrets of Dumbledore' review: Time to put 'Fantastic Beasts' out of its misery\n                            \n                    \n    \n9. Meet the Parents\n\n    \nStiller vs. De Niro\n            Credit: hillip V. Caruso/Universal Studios and Dreamworks LLC/Delivered by Online USA/Getty Images\n        \nAs long as you promise to not become that guy who says “I have nipples, Greg, could you milk me?” at every family get-together, we figure it's high time to give Meet the Parents a rewatch. We say rewatch because there’s no possible world in which you haven’t seen this movie. It was everywhere. And then its lower-quality sequels were everywhere. And when we say the name Gaylord Focker, you’ll picture Ben Stiller pretending to milk a cat while Robert De Niro looks on in a silent rage. We don't make the rules! \nThis is the king of \"meeting-the-in-laws\" movies, what with De Niro as a former CIA agent surveilling, interrogating, and antagonizing his future son-in-law until Stiller reaches his acting sweet spot: freaking the f*@# out. Like most 2000s comedies, there will be some jokes that no longer work (the humor of Stiller's character career in nursing comes to mind, not to mention his first name), but the chemistry between the two leads still crackles.\nHow to Watch: Meet the Parents is streaming on Peacock.\n10. Long Way North\nThis absolutely stunning, hand-drawn film hasn't garnered as much attention as, say, Pixar's latest, but that's no reason to skip this immensely affecting French-Danish tale. Sasha (Christa Théret) is a 15-year-old aristocrat living in 19th-century St. Petersburg, Russia. Determined to find her missing grandfather, a famed explorer, and clear her family’s name, she locates a vessel and sets off with a motley crew into the unforgiving Arctic landscape. \nDirected by Rémi Chayé, Long Way North is both an epic adventure and a human drama, exploring themes of empowerment and empathy. What truly makes this 80-minute movie special, though, is its unique artistic style. The snow-covered landscape might be stark, but Long Way North makes the icy world feel both beautiful and alive.\nHow to Watch: Long Way North is streaming on Peacock.\n11. Anita: Speaking Truth to Power\nDirected by Academy Award-winning documentarian Freida Lee Mock, Anita packed the house when it debuted at Sundance, and it’s no wonder why. This thoughtful documentary is a portrait of Anita Hill, the young lawyer called to testify before the Senate about allegations that she'd been sexually harassed by Supreme Court then-nominee Clarence Thomas — when he was her boss at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, of all things. It’s sobering to watch the calm and poised Hill repeatedly be made to describe her humiliating experiences to a panel of aging, white, male politicians who are visibly uncomfortable and baffled by the subject matter. \nAnita is an important, moving primer on a major event in the fight for gender equality, especially for viewers who were perhaps too young to fully grasp their importance at the time. For those who remember the prevailing dismissive public opinion, this documentary offers us a chance to revisit these events with the sober clarity of a post-Weinstein mindset and to learn just how pivotal and galvanizing this moment was in our history. \nHow to Watch: Anita: Speaking Truth to Power is streaming on Peacock.\n12. The Big Lebowski\n\n    \n\n            Credit: Moviestore/Shutterstock \n        \nBoth the Coen brothers' most indisputably hilarious film and the greatest cinematic tribute to nihilistic philosophy in history, The Big Lebowski is more than a movie. It is, dear reader, a way of life. Jeff Bridges stars as \"The Dude\" — a simple Los Angeles man seeking justice after a case of mistaken identity leads a stranger to urinate on his living room rug.

Despicable Me\n\n    \n\n            Credit: Universal/Kobal/Shutterstock \n        \nBefore there were gentleminions swarming our movie theaters, there was Despicable Me, a surprisingly sweet and funny kids' movie about a so-called supervillain learning to care for three rambunctious young girls suddenly placed in his care. \nSteve Carrell is impeccable as the dastardly curmudgeon Gru, whose heart slowly melts throughout the course of the film. In 2010, we couldn’t have predicted that this fun, family adventure (and Universal’s attempt to compete with the Disney/Pixar CGI monopoly of the 2000s) would become the media juggernaut it is today, but honestly, we were all young and dumb in 2010. Since then, Despicable Me has spawned two (and counting) sequels, two prequels, 15 short films, multiple video games, a web series, a television special, Lego sets, and a theme park attraction.

Forgetting Sarah Marshall\n\n    \n\n            Credit: Apatow Productions/Kobal/Shutterstock \n        \nJason Segel is Peter, a television soundtrack composer whose life revolves around his TV star girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (a deliciously bratty Kristen Bell). That is until she abruptly breaks up with him. While he's naked. Cue the full frontal sobbing! \nTo get his mind off of her, Peter takes a trip to Hawaii, but unfortunately, Sarah is vacationing at the same resort with her new rock star boyfriend Aldous Snow. (Snow is played perfectly by Russell Brand in his pre-YouTube Guru years, and he resurrected the character for Get Him to the Greek two years later). Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a sweet and raunchy breakup rom-com full of characters that are flawed, idiosyncratic, and incredibly human, including Mila Kunis as Peter’s cool new love interest, Jonah Hill as an overeager fanboy, and Paul Rudd as a hippie-dippie surf instructor. And let's not forget the singing vampire puppets!\nHow to Watch: Forgetting Sarah Marshall is streaming on Peacock.\n(*) denotes writeup came from a previous Mashable list.","provider":"Mashable"},{"title":"This beginner-friendly sign language course bundle is on sale for 94% off","link":"https://mashable.com/uk/deals/best-asl-beginner-course","date":"2022-07-31 04:00:00","content":"TL;DR: The All-in-One American Sign Language Bundle is on sale for £28.72, saving you 94% on list price.\n\nAmerican Sign Language (ASL) is one of the most popular languages in the United States, and learning it may open some interesting social and professional doors you didn’t anticipate.

03:18:24","content":"又是一波信息量巨大的预告！经过前瞻第一弹对草元素体系以及第二弹对须弥地理景观的展示后，这次到来的新预告短片《明慧的序曲》集中对须弥剧情背景、魔物以及即将登场的人物们进行了介绍，不出意外这应该就是前瞻短片最后一集，下一次就该是重磅的 3.0 前瞻直播了。好了废话也不多说，接下来就盘点一下本次预告的内容并适当拓展一些重点考据吧！\n\n※ 文章内容比较多（约八千字），大家可以点击目录快速跳转查看自己感兴趣的内容。\n\n一、「虚空」系统\n预告首先对稻妻之行中由神子提供给旅行者的一个有关须弥的重要情报进行了回收，即「在须弥知识是作为一种资源被管理的」，而用来实现这一目标的工具是一种被称为「虚空」的神造系统。\n「虚空」系统为前代草神「大慈树王」所遗留的遗产，即使前代草神早已在坎瑞亚战争中逝去，但此系统依然依托继承下来的神之心稳健的运作着。「虚空」系统外观上表现为近似蓝牙耳机一样的设备，每位须弥人都有佩戴（这可能是强制的）。目前已知的线索还不足以解读出「虚空」系统的实质和作用，不过结合「知识资源化」这一背景进行合理推测，似乎可以将「虚空」系统视为一种「综合情报管理系统」与「知识数据库」进行理解。\n\n类比现实中进行学术研究时使用的学术期刊数据库（利如 ScienceDirect、Scopus、Wiley、知网等），须弥可能将有重要价值的知识存储在依靠神之心力量构建的巨型数据库中，当有须弥人需要使用这些知识时，可向系统发出申请，通过「付费」（即支付代价，但代价未必是金钱。从早先层岩剧情海迪夫的对话中也能看出大多须弥学者是视世俗金钱为粪土的）来向脑中载入所需的知识。\n如果系统判定申请者已经失去了使用这些知识的资格，可能就会收回权限。对于现实中的我们而言，这不过意味着我们不能再用自己的账号从数据库中下载论文了，但对于须弥人，这可能意味着与他们脑部连接的「虚空」系统会直接将这些知识从他们的脑中抹去。\n当然除了「下载知识」外，当教令院的学者研究出新的高价值知识时，也许他们可以像现实中科研工作者向期刊投稿一样，通过「虚空」系统向数据库上传知识进行共享。同样，就和现实中论文引用量是衡量一位科研人学界成就高低的标准一样，须弥学者们可能也会以自己上传的知识被大量用户申请调用作为一种光荣与自豪的象征。\n\n不过侧面来看，既然「虚空」系统可以直接与脑部交互，这个系统某种意义上也是最强大的「监听」系统。前瞻中提到在如今的须弥小草神并不管辖国务，种种政务均由教令院处理，如果教令院中部分高层是作为剧情中的反派势力被塑造的，那么作为国家实际统治者的他们就可能利用「虚空」系统对民众进行控制，将一切不利于实现教令院目标的想法扼杀，这也许就是《足迹》预告 PV 中提到的「学者们的智慧正在催生愚行」的含义之一吧。\n当然啦，以上这些内容也都是个人的一些大胆推测，大家看个乐呵就好，一切请以实际剧情为准。\n考据：有关「虚空」\n对了，这里还想对「虚空」这一名称进行一些简单考据。大家可能以为「虚空」所对应的英文是「Void」，但在英文版中，该词汇实际对应的翻译是一个会让各位感到非常陌生的单词「Akasha」。该词出自印度教与佛教文化，巴利文及梵语写作「ākāśa-dhātu」（天城体：आकाश），意为「空界」或「虚无界」，也可音译为「阿迦奢」，其是古印度五大元素、密宗六大元素之一\n有关「空界」的含义，《佛说稻芋经》中提到：「何谓为空？能无障碍者，名为空界。」。空界，即指由虚空构成的界，是色聚之间的间隙与界线，其特征为无障碍。因为空界存在，人因此可以识别出每个色聚的不同（这部分涉及到比较深奥的佛学概念，理解不了也很正常，我也看不懂orz）。\n简单来说，「空界」即是古代朴素哲学观中所理解的「物质与物质之间的空间」。这个词在 19 世纪后期也被西方神秘主义和招魂术所采用，用以代表象征精质与永恒的假想元素「以太」。在现代印度雅利安语和德拉威语中，该词则保留了作为「天空」的含义。\n\n二、无梦的须弥\n预告中提及的另一项重要剧情背景是「须弥人不会做梦」。这个个人推测与前代草神「大慈树王」关系不大，而与现任草神「小吉祥草王」息息相关。在 2.8 版本主线中，我们已经隐约得知小草神拥有的能力可理解为「读取思想，干涉现实」，这样一来是否可以认为：须弥人之所以不会做梦，正是因为人们的梦境被小草神取走，拿作他用了呢？\n\n目前还难以推测小草神此番举动的目的，也许小草神是要集合人类梦的力量来抵抗某种威胁（譬如之前前瞻中提及的「来自沙漠力量的侵蚀」）？也许小草神与稻妻雷神一样因某桩事件埋下了心结，让她需要取走人们的梦境来满足自己（海岛剧情提到小草神并不自由，也很羡慕自由自在的人，这可能暗示了她不佳的处境）？\n无论如何，如今的须弥人不但早已习惯了无梦的生活，甚至还认为无梦是一种「理性与智慧的象征」而对此非常自豪。然而，对于人类而言，从古至今「梦」往往都象征着一种伟大的力量，即无边无际的想象力，失去梦境真的会是一件好事吗？我并不这么认为。这也让我相信，「梦的回归」可能将是须弥主线故事的一个重要核心。\n\n考据：前代草神「大慈树王」\n这里聊一聊有关须弥前代草神的背景知识。与当代草神拥有称号「小吉祥草王」一样，前代草神也有其称号，叫做「大慈树王」（The Greater Lord Rukkhadevata）。\n「Rukkhadevata」（天城体：रुक्खदेवता）一词出自印度教四教派之一的「湿婆教」（Shaivism，也音译为「希瓦派」）信仰，含义为「树之女神」（Tree-goddess；这里间接说明前代须弥草神也是女性）。\n其实际上印度教、佛教和耆那教神话共同存在的人物「药叉女」（Yakṣiṇī，天城体：याक्षिणि；也译作「母夜叉」）的别称。药叉女常被崇拜为财富女神或修行者的守护神，当出现在《本生经》文献中时，她们被视为生活在树上的当地神灵，有时就称为 rukkha-devatā ，即树之女神。\n\n考据：当代草神「小吉祥草王」\n有关小草王称号的考据我在自己之前的文章里其实已经写过不少次了，这里就再搬运一遍吧。\n英文版中「小吉祥草王」写作「Lesser Lord Kusanali」，其中「小」与「王」意思的对应关系清晰明了，「吉祥草」则显得比较奇怪，因为其并没有写作通常的英文名「Reineckea carnea」，而是写成了较奇怪的「Kusanali」。\n「Kusanali」考虑应是源于古语言巴利语（Pāli-Bhāsā）的单词，原型词写作「Kusanāḷi」。巴利语是出现于约公元前 1500 年古印度地区的一种通用俗语（方言），「巴利」的含义乃是「佛陀的语言」或「圣典」，因相传其正是当年释迦摩尼四处说法时所使用的语言。\n「Kusanāḷi」一词可拆分为两部分理解，其中「Kusa」意为吉祥草，而「nāḷi」则为「nāḷa」(茎部) 一词的副词形式。 需要注意的是，这里提到的「吉祥草」并非指生物学意义上的吉祥草（Reineckea carnea，又名「紫衣草」），而是强调宗教意义上的吉祥草，即「羽穗草」（Desmostachya bipinnata，又名「哈法草」），传说释尊在菩提树下成道时敷此草编织成的草席而坐，因此吉祥草在佛教中被视为圣草。\n\n日语版本中，「小吉祥草王」则完全是对巴利语的片假名音译转写，「クラクサナリデビ」(kura kusanari debi) 对应「Khudda Kusanāḷi Devī」，意为「卑微的吉祥草女神」。\n实际上「Kusanāḷi」也是个菩萨名，其出处为佛教寓言故事集《本生经》，这本古印度文学经典主要讲述了释尊成为佛陀前所经历的前世轮回故事，而 Kusanāḷi 正是佛陀的某一世轮回。具体所在篇目为第十三章「吉祥草品」一二一「吉祥草本生谭」，故事梗概如下：\nKusanāḷi 是个草精灵（修炼成的菩萨），住在一个国王的花园，它和一位树灵是好友。有一天国王请木匠来修房顶，木匠想要把树灵那棵树砍了用来做梁，于是 Kusanāḷi 变成一只变色龙爬上树，让树看起来满是树洞。木匠们见这棵树上全是洞，以为树的木质不好，于是放弃了砍这棵树做房梁。这个故事体现的哲理是：即使力量弱小，也可以为朋友提供了不起的帮助。\n三、沙漠的遗民「镀金旅团」\n比较关注剧情细节的朋友应该不会对「镀金旅团」这个名字感到太陌生，在早前的活动「有香自西方来」中旅行者就已经从须弥人娜扎法琳口中听说了这一团体。在娜扎口中，镀金旅团似乎是一群「为了钱什么都愿意干」的雇佣兵，闯入他们的老巢则「十分危险」，是有着近乎盗宝团负面形象的团体。而这次预告短片则以更加正面的角度地对他们进行了介绍。\n\n「镀金旅团」中的人们在外貌与装束上与须弥民众有着非常明显的差异，他们在事实上也并不接受须弥国家机构的强力管理，而是拥有自己的小片自治区域、作为民间自由团体「以力量与智慧讨生活」，也就是充当雇佣兵。这一现状与「镀金旅团」的出身有关，他们并非雨林的土著居民，而是来自须弥西部荒芜沙漠地带的移民民族。\n\n\n相信观看过须弥前瞻第二弹《细雨与飞沙》的朋友一定对沙漠地区的奇景感到印象深刻，而围绕着沙漠存在一个巨大谜团：从此地残存的古代神庙遗迹以及大金字塔不难看出，沙漠古文明曾一度发展到极高的程度，那么究竟是什么摧毁了这个文明，让如今的沙漠仅留一地伤痕？\n\n如今，在这些被黄沙逐渐掩埋的壮观遗迹中依旧游荡着先进的超文明机器，屠戮一切企图入侵者，而神殿中残存的一些奇异设备甚至会异化沙漠中不慎靠近的野兽，让它们变得更加危险凶猛。\n从外观来看，沙漠文明机器虽与坎瑞亚机器外观存在相似之处，但也有较明显不同，加上制作组反复以「神性」、「超古代」等字眼称呼沙漠文明，我们似乎可以做出推测：沙漠文明拥有着比我们想象中悠久得多的历史，它们也许起源于远早于七神时代的提瓦特统一文明时代，即「第一王座」时期。\n\n\n实际上，作为沙漠古文明的遗民存活至今的镀金旅团一族也很难不让人联想到稻妻的海祇民与白夜国文明，也许两者其实有着类似的遭遇，母文明因变故惨遭毁灭或抛弃，残存的子民因缘际会依附于新的七神秩序而得以幸存？这一切，就要等待未来须弥剧情为我们提供解答了，我也相信镀金旅团势力会在须弥的故事中扮演一个举足轻重的角色。\n四、奇妙生物蕈兽 & 须弥异兽\n早在层岩巨渊深邃的地底我们就已见识到了「蕈兽」这种奇妙生灵，而这一族群在其发源地须弥的环境中展现出更加丰富多彩的姿态，成为须弥雨林生态系统中极为重要的一环。\n\n出于增强繁衍与保护菌群的目的，这些生长自须弥湿润泥土中的真菌族群开启了它们的加速进化过程，栖息在潮湿环境中的水蕈兽以及飘荡在林间、仿佛戴着魔法师帽的草蕈兽属于低级的小型蕈兽，比较常见；某些进化程度较高的蕈兽则在拟态上更进一步，表现出了很强的动物性，例如在雨林至深处的蕈菇之地，我们甚至能看到宛若孔雀的高级蕈兽。\n\n\n虽然蕈兽们看起来或可爱或美丽，但千万不要被外表蒙蔽而对它们掉以轻心，这些领地意识极强的生物一旦泛滥将是危险程度极高的威胁，有记载显示，曾经就有名为阿尔瓦 · 尼古拉的学者在深入蕈兽地盘后，因行为不慎被发狂的菌群吞噬，最后尸骨无存（见雷深渊法师怪物图鉴）。\n除了蕈兽外，须弥奇妙的雨林环境中也孕育了其他异兽，既有外观类似剑齿虎一样的猛兽，也有毛皮厚实、甚至身上长着蘑菇的林猪。这些生物将会是我们须弥旅途中一道有趣的风景线。\n\n\n五、即将邂逅的友人们\n新国度的冒险即将拉开帷幕，怎么少得了邂逅新的伙伴？相信不少朋友在早前就已经通过各种各样的渠道了解到了这些须弥新角色的信息（也有不少朋友是很无奈地被动接受了「爆料」），但我想说，我认为这次前瞻短片中展示的角色可比我早先看到的那些「泄露图」好看，也许是渲染的功劳？也许是带点心理作用？但有一条理肯定没错：多点等待，官方的永远才是最好的。\n「巡林官」提纳里\n\n学者型角色，隶属教令院「生论派」，如今担任巡林官一职驻守化城郭，负责巡视道成林一带。柯莱目前正在提纳里指导下进行着巡林员见习（插一句，之前的前瞻分析中我曾推测出现在须弥道路旁的奇异植物很可能是须弥的特色路灯，这下夜景画面出现，总算是验证猜想啦）。\n注：「提纳里」（Tighnari）一名的原型为生于安达卢西亚地区（现西班牙境内）的阿拉伯农学家、植物学家、诗人、旅行者和医师泰格纳里（Al-tighnari，生卒年不详），其最出名之处是撰写了一篇名为「Zuhrat al-Bustān wa-Nuzhat al-Adhhān」（字面意思为：花园之荣耀与心灵之娱乐）的农学论文，文中描述了他的前往中东的旅程并分享了对于农学和其他一些主题的看法。\n「海港学者」艾尔海森\n\n出身教令院「知论派」、身材高大相貌英俊的灰发男性，旅行者将在须弥南部海港「奥摩斯港」与这位艾尔海森先生邂逅。看起来就很可靠的他不知将为旅行者的须弥之行提供怎样的协助？\n注：艾尔海森（Alhaitham）其名的原型为阿拉伯著名学者、物理学家、数学家「伊本 · 海什木」（Ibn al-Haytham，965-1040 年），中文也译作「海桑」、「哈金」等。这位学者有大量著作和被现代科学证明了的科学发现，尤其在光学研究方面有突出成就，著有《光学之书》、《光论》、《有关托勒密的疑点》等。\n「雇佣兵」迪希雅\n\n出身沙漠民族、小麦色皮肤的飒爽御姐，隶属「镀金旅团」的雇佣兵，目前正停留在雨林与沙漠边界的一处旅团哨点中。\n注：「迪希雅」（Dehya）之名应该源自「迪亚」「Dihya」，是历史上一位柏柏尔族（Berbers；是生活在西北非洲的、说闪含语系柏柏尔语族语言的部族统称，今日该族后裔主要分布在阿尔及利亚）女王与著名宗教军事领袖，她曾团结整个北非的土著力量、领导人民抵抗 7 世纪阿拉伯帝国倭马亚王朝军队对北非马格里布（Maghreb；非洲西北部一地区，为柏柏尔人的原乡，名称意为「日落之地」）的入侵。尽管最终兵败，北非也被完全征服皈依伊斯兰教，但这位传奇女王的事迹却传颂了下来，被后世抗争的柏柏尔人视为「抵抗侵略」、「捍卫自由」的象征。\n由于在战场上出色的指挥表现，迪亚深受当时的阿拉伯军队忌惮，穆斯林将领们甚至认为这位女王掌握着预知未来的巫术，因而给她起了一个阿拉伯语绰号「卡希纳」（Al-Kahina），意为「女祭司」或「占卜者」。\n「舞娘」妮露\n\n充满异域风情、善于舞蹈的美丽红发少女。在全民崇尚智慧与理性的须弥，少女却选择另辟蹊径，追求艺术与舞蹈上的成就。可想而知，这并不是一条容易走通的道路。\n注：「妮露」（Nilou）一名是波斯名「妮露法」（Niloufar）的昵称，含义为「莲花、睡莲」，是个很漂亮也很可爱的女孩名。\n「神秘少女」纳西妲\n\n《神秘少女》……哈哈，看来官方这里还是想卖个关子，我也不剧透了，相信不少朋友也早就知道这位少女的真实身份了吧？虽然还未曾正式谋面，但其实咱们已经跟她说过话了。\n注：「纳西妲」（Nahida）这个名字可颇有来头。虽然词汇本身确实可作为蝴蝶科 Riodinidae 下的一个属名来使用，但这里主要是化用自古代波斯琐罗亚斯德教（不拗口、大家也更熟悉的叫法是拜火教）信仰中代表生育、丰产与智慧的女神「安娜希塔」（Anahita）。\n不知道大家还记不记得开在稻妻离岛的须弥特产店「葱茏之愿」？店主瓦希德时常推销的产品「丰沃之惠」就是一种能使再贫瘠的土地都可变得适宜耕种的神奇肥料，原理被解释为小吉祥草王力量的恩惠，而其英文名正叫作「Anihitian Blessing」，直译便是「安娜希塔的祝福」。\n另外根据一些学者的说法，「安娜希塔」在印度-伊朗时代（Indo-Iranian times，指公元前 1500 - 公元前 500 年）对应的神性名称应为「萨拉斯瓦蒂」（Sarasvatī），也就是说这位女神可能与印度教神话中萨拉斯瓦蒂河的水神、同样象征智慧的「辩才天女」（也叫「妙音天女」）系出同源。\n「大风纪官」赛诺\n\n总预告篇《足迹》PV 中作为须弥地区代表人物出场的少年，相比当时的形象，如今的赛诺在人物设计上已经变得更加复杂华丽，想必这也是为了匹配本次短片中公开的赛诺非同一般的身份 ——「大风纪官」（推测应该是受教令院委派管辖沙漠地区的治安长官）。\n\n注：「赛诺」（Cyno）一名推测来源于拉丁语前缀「Cyno-」（古希腊语词源「κύων」，含义为犬），这可能是指他的服装类似于古埃及神话中的胡狼头死神「阿努比斯」（Anubis）。事实上，根据场景前瞻中沙漠地区出现的包括方尖碑与金字塔在内的标志性建筑结构，已基本可以确认须弥沙漠地区设计时参考的文化原型很大概率为古埃及文明。\n短片中所提的赛诺官职名「大风纪官」英文版写作「Mahamatra」，该职务最早由古印度孔雀王朝皇帝阿育王（Aśoka）设立，全称为「Dhaṃma Mahāmātā」，意即「佛法督察」。他们是负责国家行政及司法等各个方面的高级官员，由国王授予弘扬佛法、监察宗教工作以及裁判道德问题的神圣职责，被认为是阿育王统治集团中的重要组成部分。\n带有鲜明古埃及文化元素的赛诺，其官职却出自古印度文化背景，由此推测赛诺应该是沙漠民族在须弥雨林政权中的代表人或者说沟通桥梁，因而被授予了很高的地位。\n六、教令院六学派\n文章最后一部分来和大家聊聊由角色介绍引出的对于须弥教令院六大学派的讨论。\n细心的朋友应该注意到，编剧老腰老师介绍须弥角色时在板书上写下了一系列学派与角色的对应关系，有关这些学派，其实在早先游戏剧情中就已经提供了相关的信息（主要是与须弥学者胡塞尼相关的系列活动剧情），结合起来我们可以知晓教令院下属的六大学派分别为：「生论派」、「知论派」、「明论派」、「素论派」、「因论派」，以及板书中未写上的「妙论派」。\n\n针对学派的考据我们可以由「学派」一词本身对应的翻译开始着手，可以注意到，游戏文本中「六大学派」对应的英文说法并非常见的「The Six Schools」，而是「The Six Darshans」。其中的专有名词「Darshans」是出自古代印度教的概念，意指古印度正统古典哲学（即源于婆罗门教的「正统派」，Āstika；与之对应的「异端派」称为 Nāstika，佛教与耆那教皆属此类）的六个哲学派别。六派哲学（Ṣaḍdarśanas）具体划分如下：\n\n弥曼差派（Mimāṃsā）\n吠檀多派（Védānta）\n数论派（Sāṃkhya）\n胜论派（Vaiśeṣika）\n正理论派（Nyāya）\n瑜伽派（Yóga）\n\n这还不是教令院六大学派包含的全部文化背景。根据各学派在英文版中的写法，我们还能发现它们的另一层文化原型，即涉及琐罗亚斯德教（拜火教）善恶二元论哲学中的善神信仰：\n\n\n例如，提纳里隶属的学派「生论派」英文版就写作「Amurta」，根据读音不难发现其对应从神中代表永恒与不朽的植物女神「阿梅雷塔特」（Ameretat）。在层岩巨渊雇佣探险队的学者海迪夫也属此学派，根据志琼的介绍，这一学派主要研究方向是矿产学与生物生态学。\n以此类推，艾尔海森所属的「知论派」英文写作「Haravatat」，对应从神中代表完美的水之女神「豪而挝逹」（Haurvatat），根据胡塞尼的介绍，这个学派主要研究古代符文，其成员稀少并且言谈古怪。胡塞尼自己所属的「素论派」（Aramati）对应代表谦敬的土地女神「阿尔麦蒂」（Armaiti），该派别主要以元素和地脉为研究对象。另外在 2.7 版本活动「深泥奇谭」中胡塞尼提到了「妙论派」（Kshahrewar），这个不太好直接看出原型，由其读音可知对应代表权威的金属神「克沙特拉 · 外利雅」（Khshathra Vairya），研究方向可能与冶炼锻造有关。\n至于剩余的两派「明论派」与「因论派」，目前游戏中还未有提供相关信息，但不难推测它们应当分别对应善灵神「沃胡 · 摩那」（Vohu Manah）与真理神「阿莎 · 挝西史达」（Asha Vahishta）。\n到这里应该有朋友发现，拜火教善神除去主神「阿胡拉 · 马兹达」（Ahura Mazda）外仍有七位，在数量上与六大学派无法对应，这又是怎么一回事呢？这点大抵可以联系「古时孤影」活动中胡塞尼告诉旅行者的一段话「你毕竟还没有领会过至高智慧的熏陶」来进行解释。\n\n我们可以认为所谓「至高智慧」对应着拜火教神话中的创造神「阿胡拉 · 马兹达」（其名含义即为「光明智慧之主」，Lord Wisdom；在须弥背景下应该就是代指草神），又有说法指出七位从神中象征圣灵的神「斯奔逹·麦纽」（Spenta Mainyu）真身乃是阿胡拉 · 马兹达的化身，因此这二神可被视为一体进行看待，这样就解开了数量无法对应的问题。\n顺带一提，目前游戏内容中还提到了教令院系统中的三种身份：其一为代表校外实习生的「帝利耶悉」（Dervish），原型为波斯语「德尔维希」（Darvīsh），意为乞讨者、托钵僧，是伊斯兰教苏非派的一种苦行修士；另外两种分别为地位不同的学者职称「陀裟多」（Dastūr）与「诃般荼」（Hērbad），这两者原型都是琐罗亚斯德教中的祭祀职位。\n\n结语\n经历《神奇的草元素》、《细雨与飞沙》与《明慧的序曲》这三轮预告，相信大家对即将到来的须弥已经有了一个全方位的了解（我都怀疑到正式前瞻直播时大伟哥还有什么可以说的了2333），胃口肯定也已经被吊得足足的了。\n如何看待《原神》须弥前瞻短片02——细雨与飞沙

If you're finding today's a challenge, though, we're here to help. All you need is a pointer or two, and you'll be well on your way.\nThe answer to the July 31 Wordle, puzzle #407, can be found at the end of this article, or you can simply read on for a few tips, gentle hints, and strategies to help you every day.\nWhere did Wordle come from? \nFormer Reddit engineer Josh Wardle came up with the game in 2021 as a private exercise for him and his word game-loving partner. It eventually became a staple of their family WhatsApp messaging, and that's when Wardle started to suspect he might have something special enough to merit a wider release.\nThousands of people around the globe now play this game each day, and fans have even created alternatives to Wordle inspired by the original format. This includes music identification game Heardle, Hollywood nerd faves Actorle and Framed, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.\nNot the day you're after? You'll find the Wordle answer for July 30 here.\nWhat's the best Wordle starting word?\nWe have some ideas to help you pick the perfect first move. Such tips include choosing a word with at least two different vowels to rule those building blocks in or out, plus a few common consonants such as S, T, R, or N. \nAlso, even if you're attached to your mathematically sound starter, once it's been the answer on any given day it won't be the answer again for a few years — so if you happen to get the elusive 1/6 result, celebrate by swapping out your starting five.\nWhat happened to the Wordle archive?\nWhile you could once play the entire archive of past puzzles, the archive was taken down at the request of the New York Times, according to the site's creator.\nIs Wordle getting harder?\nIf you've been finding Wordle too easy, there is a Hard Mode you can enable to give yourself more of a challenge. But unless you activate this mode, we can assure you that Wordle isn't getting harder. \nWhy are there two different Wordle answers some days?\nThe whole point of Wordle is that everyone's solving the same puzzle, with the same answer, no matter where you are in the world. However, occasionally the puzzle game will accept two different correct solutions on the same day. This aberration is due to changes the New York Times began making after it acquired Wordle earlier this year, excising words form Wardle's original list that the team considers obscure or potentially offensive. \nTo make sure you're always getting the same puzzle as everyone else, refresh your browser before you play — don't worry, the site will keep your streak.\n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            Wordle-obsessed?

The missing logos, for the cloud-based software company Salesforce, and the e-scooter rental giant Lime, were both mentioned in a report on Friday by Mashable's Matt Binder.  \nThe status of Helium's partnership with Lime was seriously in doubt after Russell Murphy, Lime's senior director of communications, told Mashable, \"Beyond an initial test of its product in 2019, Lime has not had, and does not currently have, a relationship with Helium.\" Lime indicated that as of Friday it was preparing a cease and desist letter addressed to Helium.\nIn a statement to Mashable, Nova Labs, Helium's parent company, acknowledged Friday that Lime and Helium had grown apart after that 2019 product test. \"Lime has since restructured and the team members we worked with are no longer employed there,\" the statement read.\n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            Former Coinbase manager, 2 others, charged in crypto insider trading scheme after trying to flee the country\n                            \n                    \n    \nLime's supposed status as a client was not trivial, but part of what appeared to be a core part of Helium's marketing pitch. Helium bills itself as a decentralized network of Internet of things (IoT) devices, capable of providing their own connectivity where existing internet service providers can't or won't. Helium's hardware is, in a sense, only as good as the network of users keeping it functioning — except there's a bonus value proposition: the devices also mine a cryptocurrency, $HNT,  whenever the network is used. And as long as major tech companies are customers, there is, in theory, plenty of crypto to be mined.\nIn a New York Times story from February, the use of the Helium network by Lime is cited as evidence that Helium is \"a real product used by real people and companies every day.\" In fairness, the Times story also mentions that Helium is used by the Victor mouse trap company as well — apparently for its line of IoT-enabled mouse traps — and the reality of that partnership does not appear to be in dispute at this time. \nHowever, as of yesterday, Salesforce, the other company associated with a logo now missing from Helium.com (and from the site's \"Enterprise\" page as well) had not commented publicly on its relationship with Helium. Mashable reached out to Salesforce for a statement about the logo's removal, but at press time, had not heard back.\nMashable also reached out to Helium but had not received a comment as of this writing.

Everywhere you turn there’s a little one with a device of some kind in their hand. Like it or not, technology is just as much a part of our kids’ daily lives as it is our own. And more often than not, parents have given their wee one a set of headphones to listen to their favorite show or game. While headphones for babies and kids certainly have their place — listening to music, a show, or even just to block out background noise — they aren’t without their drawbacks.\nYou might think that the main benefit to buying headphones for your children is so that you don't have to hear what they're listening to, but there's actually a more important reason. Your child's ears are super sensitive while they're developing and it's possible to damage them by hearing sounds over 85 decibels. Adult headphones just aren't the best idea for them to use, as they can crank the volume way past a safe listening level. That is, at least not unless you can convince them to lower the volume, which is pretty unlikely.\n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            The best wireless earbuds for listening on the go\n                            \n                    \n    \nInstead, you're best off purchasing a pair of headphones designed specifically for children. They tend to fit better on little heads and all of the best headphones for kids contain a volume limiter so the sound can't get too high and potentially damage their hearing. Adult headphones are bulkier and heavier than headphones designed specifically for kids. Plus, headphones can be expensive, and we all know kids are hard on their belongings. If you give them your headphones to use, or purchase a set of adult headphones just for them, you could be shelling out a lot of money for a replacement pair when they inevitably get broken. This is just one more reason why you’re better off buying your kid their own set of headphones.\nFinding the best headphones for children is about more than just fun, colorful designs, and affordability. To ensure you’re choosing the safest headphones for your kids, you’ll want to limit volume levels to protect little ears. Here are some things to keep in mind when purchasing the beds kids' headphones. \nShould I get wired or wireless headphones for my kid?\nThe decision on whether or not to get wired or wireless headphones for your kid is largely dependent on how much money you want to spend and whether or not you want to worry about needing to recharge headphones on a regular basis. Many of the wireless headphones listed here have decent battery life, but they are typically more expensive than a wired solution.\nMany people (kids included) prefer wired headphones for their reliable connection and superior sound quality. One thing to keep in mind, particularly for young children, is that wired headphones can be a strangling risk, so always supervise them while they're using wired headphones. This is also an important consideration if there are younger siblings in the house who might get their hands on an older sibling’s wired headphones.\nWhat's the maximum recommended noise level for children?\nGenerally, many auditory health organizations recommend that the ideal noise level for a child is about 70 decibels, and that volumes should never exceed 85 decibels. (Anything above 85 decibels is deemed dangerous, and could result in hearing loss or damage.) Most adult headphones peak at about 115 decibels, which is why it's important to use a dedicated solution for your child. The limit is a limit too, not a guide, so always aim to play music a little quieter if you can.\nCan headphones damage children's hearing?\nAccording to the WHO and CDC, headphones can absolutely damage children’s hearing, which is why it’s so important for parents to know and manage their child's exposure to loud sounds. It’s also why headphones designed specifically for kids are recommended for little listeners, in order to help avoid any permanent damage to their hearing. Remember hearing damage is permanent and once it is gone it is gone.\nConsider noise-limiting apps\nWhen it comes to setting audio level limits for your kid(s) many parents might be pleased to learn that there are actually apps that allow you to set a volume limit for a device. This way you can feel confident knowing that your child isn't listening to audio at an excessive volume. Most experts agree that keeping the device at or below 50 percent of the maximum volume is a good place to start when it comes to safe listening. In addition, ensure your child is taking listening breaks to help protect their hearing.\nShould kids use noise-canceling headphones?\nKids should absolutely be using noise-canceling headphones if possible. They can help to preserve your child’s hearing by blocking out louder background noise, which means they can listen to their audio at a lower level. In addition, noise-canceling headphones can also be helpful when it comes to blocking out external noise when your child needs to focus on things such as homework. This is especially beneficial for children who have trouble with auditory processing or attention span issues — and when used in a classroom setting, noise-canceling headphones can help kids stay on task and improve their focus. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, you can even use noise-canceling headphones to help protect kids’ ears from loud noises — such as at a concert or other loud event. Because the headphones reduce the amount of noise that reaches the eardrums, they can help to prevent hearing damage.\nCan a child use earphones or earbuds?\nWhen most people think about earphones as it relates to headphones, they think about earbuds. In-ear buds are great for adults, but they're not recommended for children. That's because their developing ears are more sensitive to noise damage. This is because their nerve fibers are still growing. Also, since they have smaller external auditory canals, their eardrum is always closer to the sound source. You don't want that to be exacerbated by earbuds — their little ears are too delicate to risk their safety.\nHow long should my child use the headphones for?\nAs with screen time in general, it's worth laying out some sensible guidelines, in order to give both eyes and ears a break and make time for other types of activities. That said, there's no hard limit: Some experts say that children can use headphones up to 40 hours a week, which is probably way more than most kids will get to. \nWhether you’re looking for a set of Bluetooth headphones, wired headphones, a budget-friendly model, or something that’ll stand up to daily wear and tear, here are the best headphones for kids, based on features, volume limits, and overall comfort.","provider":"Mashable"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds: Our top picks for the best sound on the go","link":"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-wireless-earbuds","date":"2022-07-30 20:46:39","content":"With fewer devices having headphone jacks, Bluetooth headphones and earbuds have become the norm in recent years. A wireless pair of earbuds means you don’t have to worry about cords getting tangled in your pocket or bag. You just pop them out of their case and into your ears and you’re good to go.\nWhether you’re listening to the latest episode of your favorite podcast, or hitting the gym with your playlist on repeat, the right pair of wireless earbuds can make or break your listening experience. \nJust because you’re ditching the cord, doesn’t mean that you have to sacrifice performance. Today’s wireless earbuds offer sound quality that’s nearly comparable to many wired earbuds. And with Bluetooth technology getting better and better, you don’t have to worry about frequent dropped connections. \nThe wireless earbuds on our list are some of the best-performing, longest-lasting, or best-value out of various models available on the market. If you’re looking for portable sound without the disruption of a Bluetooth speaker, check out our list of the best wireless earbuds below.\nWired earbuds vs. wireless earbuds\nWireless earbuds connect to your devices via Bluetooth, and usually after you’ve paired them once, they connect automatically when you put them in your ears. Most devices have Bluetooth capabilities, but not every electronic has an aux port, so wireless earbuds are honestly the safer choice, unless you want to carry around an adapter everywhere you go.\nConnection with Bluetooth earbuds is quite reliable, so you shouldn’t experience too many audio drops or connectivity issues with wireless earbuds.\nWhile wired headphones can provide better connection and sound quality, they tie you to your phone or computer, so you’re not able to walk around freely while still listening to your audio. On the plus side, you don’t have to worry about battery life with wired earbuds since they’re not battery-powered. They’re also usually cheaper than wireless earbuds if budget is a consideration. Though thanks to Black Friday deals and other sales, finding a pair of wireless earbuds at a reasonable price is less of a challenge than it used to be.\nUltimately, we do prefer to go wireless, and we’re guessing you do too since you’re here reading this.\nEarbuds vs. headphones\nOne of the first things you’ll want to consider when it comes to selecting the best headphones for your unique sitch is whether you prefer earbuds or headphones. Headphones go over or around your ears while earbuds go inside them and have a much smaller profile. Choosing between the two mainly comes down to style, comfort, and sound quality. \nSomething to keep in mind is that headphones can squeeze your head and give you a headache if you wear them too long, and while earbuds won’t do the same, they can make your ears feel sore after extended wear. It’s all about personal preference as to which fit you like better.\n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            10 of the best wireless headphones\n                            \n                    \n    \nSome benefits of earbuds are that they are easier to transport, and because they’re smaller, you don’t have many restrictions headphone users often face when it comes to wearing them. You can also wear wireless earbuds while also wearing a helmet or hat, which is not so easy or comfortable with a pair of headphones.\nThat said, on-ear and over-ear headphones do provide a better seal and have larger speakers than earbuds, causing them to be the winners in the sound quality department. There’s some give and take when choosing between wireless earbuds and wireless headphones, depending on how you’ll use them and what sort of sound quality you’re looking for.\nWhat to look for when buying wireless earbuds\nBattery life is one of the most important features to look at in a pair of wireless earbuds. You don’t want to have to take a break from your music or podcast in the middle of listening because your earbuds’ battery died. You want a pair of buds that have a long playback time as well as a decent extended battery life from the charging case. If the playback battery life is less than five hours, you’re going to have to pop the earbuds back in their case more frequently than you might want. On the bright side, though, charging cases usually work pretty quickly and a fast 15-minute charge will provide you with an hour or more of listening time. And if you prefer wireless charging, look for a pair of earbuds that has that capability.\nYou’ll also want to pay attention to how the earbuds actually fit. Do you want rubber tips? Ear hooks? If fitted silicone tips don’t sit right in your ears, the original AirPods might be more comfortable for you. PowerBeats Pros are also good if standard earbuds don’t stay in your ears, because they feature over-the-ear hooks to ensure those puppies stay put.\nSound quality and noise reduction or cancellation are also important to consider when buying wireless earbuds. Like we said, headphones are probably going to give you better audio quality, but you can still get some crisp, full sound from earbuds. Brands like Bose, Sony, and Sennheiser are known for their great sound quality, so you can expect their reputations to shine through their wireless earbuds.\nActive noise cancellation in wireless earbuds\nWhen wireless earbuds first hit the market, we didn’t see many with noise cancellation abilities, but now it seems that noise-canceling earbuds are the standard. This means newer models of wireless earbuds cost a bit more than their predecessors, but in our opinion, the extra cost is worth it.\n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            Best noise-canceling headphones for blocking out the world\n                            \n                    \n    \nActive noise cancellation isn’t the same in earbuds as it is in headphones. Over-ear headphones can create a sound-blocking seal that you just physically cannot get with earbuds. But earbuds with silicone tips still do a pretty good job creating a seal that allows for ANC. It’s definitely enough for blocking out noisy coworkers or a loud, bustling street.\nMost earbuds with active noise cancellation also have some form of transparent or ambient mode that you can turn on to hear what’s going on around you.\nAre true wireless earbuds worth it?\nLet us put it simply: YES. Truly wireless earbuds give you totally free mobility (within range of your device, which is usually about 30 feet). You're able to walk around the house or office, go for a run, and so much more without being tethered to your phone. You also won't experience the awful yank that happens when you drop your phone while wearing wired earbuds.\nWireless earbuds that have a connecting cord still run the risk of getting caught on something and getting tugged out of your ears. Truly wireless earbuds are the only way to avoid this hassle.\nAre cheap wireless earbuds good?\nWireless earbuds are an item to splurge on. A low price tag may sound appealing, but you’re going to be losing out on sound quality, features, and durability. Dropping $200 for a pair of earbuds might not seem ideal, but you know for that price they’re going to last. Opting for a cheap pair of wireless earbuds could mean that you’ll have to replace them not long after buying. And in the end, that’ll cost you more than if you just bought the nice, expensive pair from the start.\nHowever, there are a few decent wireless earbuds under $100 — you just won’t get as many features. Which is totally fine if you’re more budget-focused. Just know that if you dip into the $20 to $30 range, you shouldn’t expect much in terms of quality and longevity.\nHow AirPods compare to other wireless earbuds\nApple is almost always going to be one of our top picks. The company just knows what it’s doing. That said, there are some other wireless earbuds that give Apple's buds a run for their money.\nBose, Jabra, and Sony have stellar sound quality that meets or surpasses Apple. And the brands feature different designs for their buds if you don’t like the way AirPods look. It seems like most wireless earbuds now have silicone ear tips, so the original AirPods stand out by having an earpiece we’re familiar with from Apple’s wired earbuds.\nChoosing the best wireless earbuds for you mostly comes down to your personal preferences, but here’s a guide to help you directly compare the top earbuds on the market based on specs like battery life, style, noise-canceling features, music controls, and more.","provider":"Mashable"},{"title":"Best senior dating sites: Dating over 60 can actually be fun","link":"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-seniors","date":"2022-07-30 20:24:19","content":"Welcome to the no-bullshitting age of dating.\nDating at any age is awkward, scary, and often, a pain in the ass. True, being in the over-60 group may mean that more people your age are already off the market — but online dating can prove that the mature dating pool isn't dismal, even if your local one is.\nIt's quite normal to feel hesitant about making the jump to online dating as a senior. Finding a dating site that feels comfortable and natural is intimidating at any age. 20- and 30-somethings have a hell of a time finding a dating app that works for them — there are almost too many options. Late baby boomers (and early Gen X-ers) have a more straightforward approach.\nYouth has another disadvantage that older singles may not have considered: Many people in their twenties and thirties just aren't ready to settle down. Developing a crush on someone is more likely to end with an awkward \"situation-ship\" rather than something serious. Most 60+ folks have been figuring this whole \"love\" thing out for longer than millennials have been alive. With life experience and possible previous marriages under your belt, you know the red flags and you know what you want.\nSEE ALSO: For finding a serious relationship, these dating sites are the best\nEliteSingles’ senior dating blog notes that most older individuals realize that life is just too short to play games and that older people take dating much more seriously than they did 40 years ago. Who cares if this person isn't your first (or second, or third) love? The potential for lasting love is what matters. As one person in the Reddit thread datingoverfifty suggests, if you want commitment, a site with a high barrier to entry — like eharmony, Match, or Elite Singles — could help to weed out people who aren't about to pay a high monthly price just to mess around.\nDespite the added layer of seriousness, butterflies are still in your cards. You'll get giddy like a teenager, wait for them to call, and do a happy dance when they do, and first kisses will be just as tingly. And if you want to skip the heavy, emotional stuff altogether, just say that in your bio. There are plenty of other mature singles who are looking for anything from a casual hookup partner to a traveling companion or workout buddy. Many singles in their 50s and 60s have found more success (due to the sheer number of people) on apps with heavy millennial influence, like monster swiping app Tinder and Bumble — where women aren't bombarded by messages from men.\nWhat should I consider when choosing a dating site?\nWhat kind of relationship are you interested in finding? Before signing up for a single dating app, consider exactly what you’re hoping to find. Do you want a companion to spend time with as you head into retirement? Do you want someone younger who can keep up with your fast-paced lifestyle? Maybe you just want something casual and exciting (no shame!). Whatever it is that you’re looking for—there’s a site for it.\nSite popularity: You might be tempted to sign up for niche dating sites in order to narrow the funnel in terms of your potential matches — but the more popular the site is, the better. Sites that have lots of users mean lots of chances to match with someone you click with.\nEase of use: Most apps and websites are pretty straightforward — but certain sites are much more clear and easy to sign up for than others. Certain sites will give you a multi-step sign-up with endless questionnaires to better match you—but there are many apps and sites that skip over all that and get straight into it if you just want to browse around.\nSocial media integration: Dating sites with social media integration are going to be your best bet in terms of making sure you’re chatting with real people and not bots or catfish. There are even websites available that only match you with friends-of-friends if you’re particularly concerned on that front. \nSecurity: Like social media integration, dating app or website security should be top of mind when choosing a site. Make sure the site you’re signing into offers photo verification and the ability to block any unsavory members who might be looking for a target to take advantage of.\nBudget: There are lots of free sites and apps out there — but the free version is often lacking in in-depth features and other aspects that make meeting someone easier. Consider how much you’re willing to spend per month before jumping into just any site.\nWhat others are saying: Before you sign up for a dating website or app, it doesn’t hurt to read a couple of user reviews first. If the app or website has anything less than 3.5 stars you’ll probably want to steer clear.\nSo, what are the best dating sites for seniors?\nSome of the websites we’ve noted down are for all ages with a senior option, and some sites are specifically for people over 50. All of the sites have free memberships, but to get the real in-depth features (like unlimited messaging or seeing photos), you'll probably need a paid account. From easy-to-use apps to more serious-minded dating websites, here’s to finding love later in life!\nHere are the best dating sites for seniors in 2022. (Note that prices for dating apps and sites are constantly changing. We update regularly, but there might be minor price differences.)","provider":"Mashable"},{"title":"Gmail gets a new look, Instagram trips while trying to be TikTok and India blocks Battleground Mobile","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/30/gmail-gets-a-new-look-instagram-trips-while-trying-to-be-tiktok-and-india-blocks-battleground-mobile/","date":"2022-07-30 20:16:26","content":"Hello hello!

Previously, the plan included several steps to introduce a Sample Fetch Rover into missions, which is now replaced by two (really cool and kind of cute) recovery helicopters within the main Sample Retrieval Lander. \n\n    \n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n    \n\nThis design is spearheaded by both NASA and the European Space Agency. The European Space Agency is developing the Earth Return Orbiter, a device that will actually make the historic round-trip from Earth to Mars and back again, NASA explained, as well as a Sample Transfer Arm that will place sample tubes within the device. The new changes will lead scientists to begin building the first prototypes over the next year. \nThe alterations to the program's novel design are inspired by recent successes in ongoing missions, says Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “There are some significant and advantageous changes to the plan, which can be directly attributed to Perseverance’s recent successes at Jezero and the amazing performance of our Mars helicopter,” Zurbuchen wrote in the announcement.\n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            NASA rover finds weird trash on Mars\n                            \n                    \n    \nThe current Mars helicopter, known as Ingenuity, was first launched in July 2020 on the back of Mars' Perseverance rover, and was used as a test for sustained, controlled flight on the surface of another planet. Ingenuity's since completed several successful test flights, hovering around the planet's surface and returning back to land, and was the first flight of its kind in any world beyond Earth, NASA explained. \n\"Working together on historic endeavors like Mars Sample Return not only provides invaluable data about our place in the universe but brings us closer together right here on Earth,” said Zurbuchen.\n\n    \nOriginal concept art for the retrieval program, which included a small sample rocket.\n            Credit: NASA / JPL-Caltech\n        \nMars helicopter images from April show debris on the planet's surface.\n            Credit: NASA / JPL-Caltech\n        \nSimultaneously, a collection of samples is being retrieved by NASA’s Perseverance rover in the planet's Jezero Crater, which will then be sent back to our home planet for study. In the new design, beloved Perseverance will act as the primary means of delivering samples to the Sample Retrieval Lander alongside the helicopters. \nThe plan has excited many interested in the Red Planet for a long while. On July 25, representatives from NASA and the European Space Agency laid out the current plan for sample return, which sets the launch of the Earth Return Orbiter and Sample Retrieval Lander in fall 2027 and summer 2028, respectively.\nBut we can't get too excited just yet.
